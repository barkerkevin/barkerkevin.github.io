    <p>Sweet  Egmont</p>
    <p><em>This is the twelfth and  last in a series of columns of historical interest about places on the Sunshine  Coast. It&rsquo;s meant to help visitors and newbies to get to know something about  us, but it&rsquo;s also useful to old-timers who&rsquo;ve forgotten (or never learned) some  of our stories.</em></p>
    <p>Folks who&rsquo;ve never been to tiny Egmont because they were  in a rush to catch the Earl&rsquo;s Cove ferry to Powell River missed the chance to  explore one of the sweetest and most unique communities on the Coast. You have  to turn off the highway and make a side trip of about 6 km to find it. In a  recent  &rdquo;Voices of Egmont&rdquo; column in this  newspaper, Jackie Montgomery let us in on some goings on in this largely  isolated  village. Folks gather here for  movie night at the Community Centre, she reported, or they attend history  lectures at the Egmont Heritage Centre, and they play in Texas Hold&rdquo;Em  tournaments at the Backeddy Pub. More fun than going home and watching TV, eh?</p>
    <p>Egmont is located on the southwest side of  the mouth of Sechelt Inlet, north of the Skookum­chuck Rapids, though at  various stages of its history it was also located on the northeast side. The  tiny community was called Skook­um­chuck till 1917, when Walter Wray applied  for a post office designa­tion and called it Egmont. </p>
    <p>Its official where­abouts depended on where  the post office happened to be at the time. Controlling the mail meant life or death  to a general store owner. At one point, in 1921, Walter Wray actually hijacked  it from the then-postmaster George Hatashita, towing it by barge to his own  place on the east shore. The struggle went on for years, with the post office  being relocated so often that eventually Canada Post lost its patience and de­clared  its final and irrevocable location to be Egmont, where it is now.</p>
    <p>Egmont guarded its isolation from the world  till 1956, when the road to the main highway was completed. But connecting to  the outside hasn&rsquo;t changed it much. Few people on their way to catch the Earl&rsquo;s  Cove ferry to Powell River take the time to follow this apparent road to  nowhere. But for those who do, it&rsquo;s a step into the past. You can have a beer  at the Backeddy Pub or shop at the general store, just like folks have always  done. And you&rsquo;ll be welcome.</p>
