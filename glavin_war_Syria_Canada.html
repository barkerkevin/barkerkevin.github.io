<h2>Is it hubris, fame, or just the chance to purge sixty years of liberal foreign policy? Kevin Barker probes the murky mess of Canada's combat mission to Iraq.</h2>
LUND, B.C. &#8212;I visited <a href="http://transmontanus.blogspot.ca/">Terry Glavin’s</a> Facebook page recently, on the eve of last week’s historic debate in the house on this Iraq War <em>redux</em>, and found his fan base waxing wroth; not over ISIS and Syria as one might expect, but Canada. <em>Who does that?</em>  Glavin, a boat hippie from the Gulf Islands who writes about science and now seems hyperfocused on the Middle East, had blithely stated that he was ashamed - <em>ashamed</em>  - of fellow citizens who deemed it prudent to discuss the matter. And not merely of the official opposition for asking dingbat questions like how much will a combat mission cost and how long will it take, not just of Trudeau and Mulcair mind, but the whole damned country. Fred and Ethel and big Aunt Bertha in Kamloops too. The <em>Glavinettes</em> in the cheap seats eagerly chirped their approval; apparently they too were deeply ashamed.</p>
<p>My own pacifist views attracted immediate ground fire. A woman said my thinking offended her. Someone else was incensed I could sit idly by and let the world to do the “heavy lifting” in Iraq, which I loved, because it exposes the fact that the <em>real deal</em> for the hairy-arsed  macho shitheads pushing us to war is a 15-minute sortie in which someone splashes a few <em>probable</em> IS fighters in a bunker and flies back to Kuwait for tea and medals. The diplomacy that goes on before and after, the remediation of towns and cities, the finding of homes for orphans and refugees, the purging of land mines, the truth and reconciliation commissions, the treatment of PTSD victims, the collection of tax revenues to finance it – that’s women’s work.</p>
<p>I might have articulated it too, except by now Glavin had glimpsed who and what I was; a Trudeau liberal who whines about rights and freedoms but won’t pick up a rifle, and for whom his fraternal Fleet Street cronies at Euston Group in London (they have a manifesto and <em>everything!</em>) have a special hatred.  He hove into view with all sails full and billowing and cannons blazing, the master and commander. “Fuck off”, he said.“You don’t know what you’re talking about. Don’t post anything here,” and adding for good measure his trademark chastisement of “go to bed”, which is a cutesy way of telling his real and imagined detractors they have the mental age of their shoe size. </p>
<p>I pondered this while wiping his spittle off my lapels. <em>Fuck off!</em>  I see.  Well, that’s mature. The thing about Glavin is he's  like those rich useless people in Scott Fitzgerald’s novels, oblivious to the carnage left in their wake. They join intellectual societies, publish books, talk a lot of impassioned shit about dissent and revolution at lectures, visit interesting places and bestow credit or blame; but they’re really just that guy in <em>My Dinner with Andre</em> making a big deal about Findhorn. Why should I give a fuck how big their turnips are when I live in Sechelt?</p>
<p>Glavin never served a day in his life. His ancestors, being Irish, probably didn’t either. While they were busy with the Easter Rising mine were face down in the mud at the Somme. I had eight great uncles in that skirmish. One got shell shocked and ran like a madman over enemy lines where he was obliterated by a shell cluster during a bombardment, probably from our own artillery. My cousin Lt. Col. William (Bily) Barker remains the most decorated airman in British military history. I lost two cousins in the second war, one a spitfire pilot in Burma, the other in North Africa. I come from a long line of war-mongering, military men so don’t tell me - <em>you prick</em> - that it’s necessary to send Canadian troops on a combat mission to Syria because I know damn well it isn’t. “<em>But didn’t the U.S. officially ask for Canada’s help?</em>”, goes the plaintive refrain of the apologists. Uh, aCtually NO. According to a U.S. Department of Defence source who was quoted and named by a Canadian media outlet last September, the DoD officially responded to an offer of assistance made earlier by Harper. We signed up for this. We volunteered.</p>
<p>Sorry, did I say <em>Syria?</em> I meant Iraq. I stand corrected. <em>But isn’t Assad the villain here?</em> Man, these are confusing times for the New Left. Of course we all want to support Israel and fight tyrannical leaders like Assad the world over with sanctions and air strikes. But apparently we need permission from the world's biggest baddie to hit the Islamic State in Syria. Harper tabled that during the vote in the house: We’re going to continue giving Assad our best menacing grimace, unless and until he gives us the green light and then we’ll move the combat mission to Syria.</p>
<p>If you think that’s f**ked up, wait till it`s time to carve the Kurdish bits out of Syria and Turkey and Iraq for a UN approved, Israel-friendly, sovereign state called Kurdistan. Boy, that has a snowball’s chance in hell. We can’t even get the Turks to engage IS on the ground in the transborder region because they consider as separatists the Kurdish <em>peshmergas</em> who are fighting them, and who incidentally count Iran among their early backers. <em>Tabernac, eh?</em> There is also some question at the moment as to whether Ankara is even providing air bases for coalition missions as reported.  Whatever! The important thing to remember is it’s all a piece of cake ... home by Easter ... <em>tea and medals</em> ... What a lot of horse shit!</p>
<p>However, I am interested in pairing up Prime Minister Harper’s assertion that his personal Middle East frenemies are also Canada’s (enticing our citizens to join the cause, etc.), with a logical outcome to this shiny new combat mission there. Is it that IS will glimpse the Canadian Armed Forces insignia on our aircraft, mutter - <em>krist, it’s Harper</em> - and send their Canadian recruits back? If that’s why we’re sending them? Then I’m all for it. Only it isn’t. This mission is doomed and it won’t be over in six months. Know how I know? Because of all the glad handing and backslapping and good-natured guffaws in the government benches in the house on October 3. This is the same kind of thumbs up hubris that saw the boys off in August, 1914. Sane people commit troops to these overseas follies with dread and misgivings, not zealousness and wide-eyed wonder. Or they sneak them in the back door like Cretien did in Afghanistan after declining a role in the 2003 Iraq War, and simultaneously blindsiding the electorate with a marijuana legalization bill, which btw was a stroke of political genius.</p>
<p> I don’t need reasoned arguments or sources to call this one because it’s obvious as hell. We won't accomplish shit there in six months, if ever. Nope, we’re there for good. The objective is clearly to move everything back to the 1920 League of Nations mandates that gave Syria to the French back when it still comprised Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel and do it all over again. And make the same mistakes, I might add. It’s a morass.</p>
<p>Here’s my solution:  We send in journalists and blog the enemy to death. Yep. Hundreds, no – thousands of them. A few will get scragged but we’ll just send 10 more in their place. Let’s dig up Chris Hitchens and drop him in the center of Kobani with a note in Arabic that says “I’m right and you’re wrong - any questions?” Forget moving the UN headquarters to Jerusalem; we’ll move the offices of the Washington Post to Baghdad. We send them Martin Amis. Jeff Buzos can commute from California. Let’s air drop millions of iPhone6’s with news reader apps in Farsi and Urdu. <em>We’ll unleash the tourists!</em> That’s what Musharref jokingly suggested in Pakistan when asked during an interview how to find Osama bin Laden. I think it’s a fucking capital idea. For Afghanistan anyway. The opium poppy growing farmers can sell trinkets and cappuccinos. I’m in earnest. The Thai's did it in the Golden Triangle in the ‘90s and the Shan heroin empire dwindled to nothing.
