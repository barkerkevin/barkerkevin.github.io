    <p>Land  between Two Waters<br>
      <em>This is the  eighth in a series of columns of historical interest about places on the  Sunshine Coast. It&rsquo;s meant to help visitors and newbies to get to know  something about us, but it&rsquo;s also useful to old-timers who&rsquo;ve forgotten (or  never learned) some of our stories. </em> <br>
      The name  &ldquo;Sechelt&rdquo; is based on the native word &ldquo;Shishelh&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;land between two  waters&rdquo; – Georgia Straight and Porpoise Bay. Although Native people preceded  Europeans for thousands of years here, the Sechelt Indian Band (SIB) wasn't  formed till  the early 1860&rsquo;s, when four  sub-tribes were amalgamated and moved to their present location, next to the  village of Sechelt. Originally there were over 20,000 members, but a  controversial smallpox epidemic reduced their numbers to less than 200.  Visitors to the Sunshine Coast don&rsquo;t realize that they are on traditional  native land when they drive between St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital and the Ravens Cry  theatre, just before reaching the Wharf Avenue traffic light.<br>
      Sechelt was  estimated in 2007 to be just over 9,000 people, most of whom are over 45. Yes,  we&rsquo;re a passel of retirees, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we just sit in a corner and  watch TV. We attend the annual writers festival, dragon boat races, theatrical  productions, art shows, and a host of other activities. Some of us even write  columns.<br>
      The first  European to settle here was Thomas John Cook, who named his property  &ldquo;Shorncliffe&rdquo;, but the one who really built Sechelt was Bert Whitaker. He  erected the first store in 1896, then followed with hotels, rental cottages,  wharves, and even his own fleet of ships to bring summer people up from  Vancouver. He also owned two lumber mills and five logging camps. He named most  of the streets in central Sechelt as well – Medusa, Dolphin, Ocean, Trail and  Cowrie among others. In 1896 he became Sechelt&rsquo;s first postmaster.<br>
      There are  many stories about Old Bert, not all of them admiring. He was accused of  watering milk cans and deliberately delaying loggers so they would miss the  steamer to Vancouver and thus be forced to spend a night in his waterfront  hotel. He is remembered for charging them 25 cents to sleep on the beach if  there was no room at the inn. But hey, we're not like that today.<br>
      I love the  story about our municipal center, the one with the tower in my drawing. We held  two referendums about what to do with the old town hall on Inlet and whether or  not to build a new library. We voted no on the town hall proposition but yes on  the new library. So the town fathers of the day built a library in accordance  with the wishes of the electorate, and then plunked new town offices on top of  it with the money they got from the sale of the old town hall. We got a new  town hall (at no cost, mind you) even though we voted against it. Nobody seemed  to mind, though.<br>
      The tower  was an unexpected addition, dreamed up by our then-administrator, who loved the  idea of a Swiss clock tower. He told me that perhaps some time in the future we  might build a third story, and the tower would just sort of melt into it.<br>
      Two of our  Farmers&rsquo; and Artisans&rsquo; Market vendors deserve special mention in this column.  We have lots of famous people in Sechelt, but Corin and Brian Mullin are the  first to appear on CBC&rsquo;s <em>The Dragons&rsquo; Den </em>program. They make a breakfast  food called &ldquo;Holy Crap&rdquo; which they say builds energy and reduces toxic waste.  Brian says they are scheduled to appear sometime this fall. Watch for it!<br>
