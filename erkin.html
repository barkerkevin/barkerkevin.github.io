      <p><span style="font-size: 24px; color: #03C;">Erkin</span> <span style="font-size: 18px"> | by jeff keller</span></p>
      <p style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px; color: #F00;">I</span>nspector Spall rode the shoeway to the banquet room where  the Gost (according to the Curator of Schedules), was in the process of  ingesting its midday meal. Sunlight shone, as it always did, through the  crystal ceiling, and Spall louvered his eyelids until all but a halfmoon of  pupil was shielded from the glare of the tablecloths. Spall disengaged from the  shoeway and slowed his momentum with a practiced quickstep, then shaded his  eyes with a gloved hand and panned his vision in a level arc across the vast  and empty table-land. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There were tiny knots, saw Spall, of protoplastic, mineral,  vegetative, energetic, inferred and hybrid lifeforms, clustered loosely around  tables or tightly around troughs or singly at feeding tubes, depending on  morphology and custom. Each small cluster formed the hub of a wheel, its spokes  traced dynamically by bus-boys, waiters and Assistant Victuallers, a thousand  crawling sychophants, each in the Grape and Ochre, VisHosp holograms proudly  bowing on the epaulettes. It should all have amounted to a pretty sight,  thought Spall, but each wheel formed only a lonely and disconnected archipelago  in the grand expanse of the banquet room, which had been raised, thanks to  low-gravity engineering, higher and wider than anything on earth, an immense  and somewhat pompous structure designed to both feed and impress the hungry  hordes of extra-terrestrial diplomats and sightseers predicted by the contact  team. (But the throngs, intoned some bitter member of Spall's inner-most council,  had never come.)</p>
    <p>Spall's sources had suggested the northeastern periphery,  and it was here he concentrated his gaze. In time he was able to make out a  party of one in that general direction. Although it was too far away to make  out features, the seated figure displayed a tiny bump to one side, and  otherwise fit the subject's description (again, as provided by the Curator of  Schedules). </p>
    <p>Spall engaged his shoe and stepped onto a northbound  subduction circuit, which drew him at about twice the speed of walking in the  appropriate direction. As he glided forward he passed between rows of empty  tables, rarely or never used, but adorned, every day, with a brave, if  pointless, flower from earth.</p>
    <p>When Spall was a half-minute's walk to the Gost's table he  disengaged his shoe and stepped off the circuit, proceeding towards the contact  point at a dignified pace. As he walked he peered surreptitiously at the Gost,  and especially at the service and dishes laid out for the alien's repast. </p>
    <p>The malaise that had twisted Spall's guts since his visit to  the Cellar-General's office amplified when he noted that the delegate was  avoiding the <em>proschtl</em>, which he identified by its large silver chafing  dish. He worked his way closer still, then sidled up beside an Assistant Victualler. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;May your service sparkle and shine,&rdquo; whispered Spall. &ldquo;I  have come to speak with the Gost. Is there a problem with the <em>proschtl</em>?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Assistant Victualler twitched a muscle behind his ear,  and imperceptibly stiffened his neck.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I haven't enquired,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It's not my place.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
  &ldquo;Then  unstiffen your neck,&rdquo; suggested Spall, &ldquo;and tell me what you've observed. No <em>proschtl</em> – no treaty. No treaty, no alliance. No alliance, and we can sit here like a  cartful of pastries and wait for the Meidr to come.&rdquo; The Assistant Victualler  relented. He spoke slowly, at all times keeping his eyes on the Visitor, using  hand gestures to command his scurrying boys.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;First it lifted the lid,&rdquo; whispered the Victualler. &ldquo;Then  it sniffed and poked the <em>proschtl</em>. Then it....&rdquo;  There was a pause, and Spall could almost  hear the Victualler's mental clockwork ticking as he rifled through his  vocabulary. &ldquo;He <em>ululated</em>.&rdquo; The Assistant Victualler's lips compressed.  &ldquo;One of the trencher lads broke down and cried – right there at the table.  Completely ruined for Service.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I'm sure he'll be fine in Kitchen,&rdquo; said Spall. He left the  Assistant Victualler and approached the banquet table. Although he kept his  attention focused on his target, he walked slowly, taking advantage of his  wide-set eyes to surreptitiously inspect the <em>proschtl</em>. It seemed  ordinary enough. A bit, perhaps, like ham, but tinged blue. And how, he  wondered, was he supposed to inspect a dish he had never eaten, never seen,  never read the recipe for? He took three steps towards the Gost and bent  forward to indicate a desire to speak. The delegate noticed him and grew still.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Begging your pardon, Visitor,&rdquo; said Spall, adorning his  normally severe countenance with the VisHosp Smile of Concern. &ldquo;Was there a  problem with the <em>proschtl</em>?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Gost rose up from the table and bowed, clumsily, but  without reservation. As it spoke, the diminutive Annunciator squatted by its  side, working the portable bellows that allowed the Gost to form human sounds  by focusing air through its <em>vens; </em>tentall gilled breathing tubes  that rose and swayed from the back of of the Gost's neck like a fan of cobras,  or the pipes of a medieval organ.<br>
      <br>
  &ldquo;Begging your pardon, human,&rdquo; sang the Gost in chords, &ldquo;but  this is not <em>proschtl.</em> <em>Proschtl</em> is a different dish. Very tender,  very sweet, transcendent – not like this. We are aware of the trouble you went  to, but your food-implementers have failed. This is odd, since all but the  skill were supplied. The skill, of course, and the <em>erkin</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<em>Erkin</em>?&rdquo; asked Spall. &ldquo;I'm afraid I didn't bring a  linguist. Would you mind explaining <em>erkin?</em>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<em>Erkin</em> is <em>erkin</em>,&rdquo; said Ten-prime. &ldquo;Erkin  is...qualitative, ineffable, non-material. Even when the war is over, and the <em>telmars</em> are incoherent, you must still find a <em>thrum</em> to keep the <em>erkin</em> in.  Do you see? But who can find a <em>thrum</em>? Only he who can make a <em>thrum </em>can  find a <em>thrum</em>. That which is predicable of <em>erkin</em> is predicable of <em>thrum</em>,  and both have attributes which are neither here nor there, but somewhere  in-between.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall's confusion was apparent, even across the  species-divide. Ten-prime's <em>vens</em> waved airily as he spoke.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Do not concern yourself with <em>thrum</em>, human – first  you must identify <em>erkin</em>. Look to your cooking, which may be the true  special talent. My guess is that you will find <em>erkin</em> in your kitchens.  All things considered, it is strange that you cannot make <em>proschtl</em>. In  general, your cooking is advanced. Once we have defeated the Meidr, we will  discuss the importation of foodstuffs to Gost. We are particularly fond of cake.  But for now, human, you must learn to make <em>proschtl </em>in time for the  ceremony. This is important, if you wish to gain our help against the Meidr. If  you cook with <em>erkin</em>, all the better.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Gost performed its strange side-to-side bowing  procedure, ululated briefly, then made an eerie and protracted hissing noise  before turning again to consume its meal. Spall, his face creased with worry,  ordered the <em>proschtl</em> taken away, then followed the servant into the  kitchen to confer with Chef Lakh.</p>
    <p align="center">ll</p>
    <p>After fifty-three years of ruling over VisHosp's kitchen,  Chef Lakh was beginning to show his age. He walked with a cane, dozed off  between services, and spoke from the hip. In the matter of <em>proschtl</em>, he  chose not to waste energy feigning ignorance.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I knew there'd be an issue,&rdquo; he snapped, clacking his  square yellow teeth together like ochred castanets. &ldquo;Frankly, <em>proschtl</em> goes <em>far</em> beyond our job description. Do you have any idea what a <em>proscht</em> is, Inspector? Do you have any idea how to prepare <em>proschtl</em>?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I haven't a clue,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;I only learned of <em>proschtl</em> yesterday when the Cellar-General asked me to look in on  today's luncheon. Quite frankly, Chef Lakh,  we have a problem. Small delinquencies in service can have enormous  repercussions – in this case, what hangs in the balance is the good will of the  Gost in our defence against the Meidr. What I understand from CultSynch, and  from the Gost, is that the serving of well-prepared <em>proschtl</em> is  absolutely essential to a successful treaty negotiation. No matter how  difficult or abhorrent the process, I cannot impress upon you strongly enough  that it simply, for the ongoing good of humanity, needs to be performed.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Then I think,&rdquo; said the Chef, &ldquo;that you need to meet the <em>proscht</em>.  Would you follow me please, Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;This is it, Inspector,&rdquo; said Lakh. &ldquo;But keep your voice  down, if you don't mind. Chef Reedle only just got him to sleep.&rdquo; Lakh reached  up and pulled away the tarp. Inside the cage lay the <em>proscht</em>, sleeping,  its plump blue body strapped to a board.</p>
    <p>Spall turned expectantly towards the towering Cooler complex  at the back of the Kitchen, monolithic refrigeration units built to house the  cuisines of as many (according to the Greeters) as ten thousand planetary  cultures. Many of those, as on earth, boasted hundreds, or even thousands  of  tribal subcultures, each with its own  cuisine. As of yet, however, the Coolers only stored the foods of seven worlds,  a situation that mirrored, in general, earth's status on the galactic priority  list.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Not the Coolers, Sir,&rdquo; said Lakh. &ldquo;We've been keeping the <em>proscht </em>outside, in the stockyard, next to the flickers.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&quot;The <em>proscht</em> are alive?&rdquo; asked Spall.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; replied Lakh. &ldquo;The <em>proscht</em> is  alive, and healthy, and ready for preparation.&rdquo; Chef Lakh opened the kitchen  door and led Spall outside, tapping his cane down the long, wood-planked  walkway, past cages filled with the extraterrestrial animals that VisHosp  imported for its guests from other worlds.</p>
    <p>Down past the dovecotes, which caged innumerable iterations  of the deadly Artundian monoflicker, and past the strink-pond, overgrown with  voracious but succulent water-wraiths, then around and by the side of the third  great barn, was an ordinary square cage, just big enough for a small man to  enter and lie down.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;This is it, Inspector,&rdquo; said Lakh. &ldquo;But keep your voice  down, if you don't mind. Chef Reedle only just got him to sleep.&rdquo; Lakh reached  up and pulled away the tarp. Inside the cage lay the <em>proscht</em>, sleeping,  its plump blue body strapped to a board.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Lakh,&rdquo; said Spall, &ldquo;that can't be the <em>proscht</em>?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;That <em>is</em> the <em>proscht</em>, Inspector. It was  delivered, with proper documentation and labelling, by the Deep-Jump <em>InToStella</em>,  which received the parcel from the Gost Interchange. He arrived with instructions,  extra ingredients, and, unexpectedly, an instrument called the <em>zenproschten</em>,  which you can just see peeking out from behind the cage to your left.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Lakh indicated a dull grey box about the size of a child's  coffin, then stepped to the side of the cage, reached down and pulled it  towards Spall. &ldquo;When you're done inspecting the <em>proscht</em>, I will explain  the z<em>enproschten</em> to you.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I don't want to get any closer to the <em>proscht</em> than I  have to,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;Especially since it looks like a....&rdquo; </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lakh. &ldquo;It does.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall knelt down, close enough to smell the dirt and sour  hay of the stockyard floor. The figure in the cage had an unpleasantly familiar  shape – two arms, two legs, five palp-tipped digits on each hand. But where the  swaddling left skin uncovered it glistened with an oily, blue, iridescent  patina.</p>
    <p>Spall stood. He looked off into the distance, pretending to  consider, when in reality he was attempting to bully his brain past a  perceptual impasse.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Chef Lakh,&rdquo; he said, to buy himself thinking time, &ldquo;explain  the <em>zenproschten</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Very well, Inspector,&rdquo; said Lakh, his mouth twisting over  his ogre's teeth. &ldquo;My pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Chef knelt by the <em>zenproschten</em> and touched two  square bosses on the lid, which sprang back to reveal an odd assemblage of  pans, springs, levers, cogs, wheels, rotors, hydraulics, needles, servos,  vacuums and blades. Lakh removed a succession of pans, each ornately perforated  with lace-like patterns, to reveal a final, womb-like indentation that was  shaped to encompass the <em>proscht</em>, which would, explained Lakh, be placed  face down inside the <em>zenproschten</em> with its head outside one end of the  box, its feet out the other.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Sinister,&rdquo; said Spall.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Sinister indeed,&rdquo; agreed Lakh, pulling a sheet of  instructions from a cavity in the <em>zenproschten</em>. &ldquo;As you can imagine,  there isn't a chef in the restaurant who's prepared to do the strangling – not  for any bonus.  And even before that,  there's the <em>stril</em> – here they are – they look like sharpened slivers of  bamboo. The recipe specifies that sixty <em>stril</em> must be larded into the  living <em>proscht</em>'s muscle tissue. By the way, if you touch a <em>stril</em>,  don't lick your fingers or touch your eyes till you've washed. As Chef Deepak  discovered, they are at least four times as hot as anything we grow on earth.  And by the way, the recipe advises the chef to strap the <em>proscht </em>to the  cutting board before attempting to insert the <em>stril</em>, as the <em>proscht</em>,  and I quote, 'will inevitably struggle and cry.'&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I've heard enough, Lakh,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;Tell your chefs that  as far as I'm concerned they will not be asked to...<em>prepare</em>...the <em>proschtl</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Lakh bowed. &ldquo;Thank you, Inspector. We are cooks, not  murderers. The relief will run high, and the spirits will run free. Toasts will  be raised to your wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Lakh took a flask from his back pocket, waved it in Spall's  direction and took a long pull.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; asked Spall. &ldquo;What was the <em>proschtl</em> you  served tonight?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It was a ham, Sir,&rdquo; said Lakh. &ldquo;An old-fashioned, unsmoked  ham that we soaked in blue dye. According to Access, there used to be people  called 'cannibals' who ate human flesh, which they referred to as 'long-pig.'  Given the similarities, I took a chance. Perhaps it's time to hang up my cap.  If <em>proschtl</em> becomes a regular menu item, I don't think I want to cook  here anymore.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I don't think there's much danger of that,&rdquo; said Spall.  &ldquo;However, we are playing a desperate game here, Lakh. Somehow we need to serve  the Gost a feast of <em>proschtl</em>, or we stand to lose the war against the  Meidr.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The <em>proscht</em> opened its eyes, shrugged sleepily, then  focused on Lakh and smiled. Its golden-eyed gaze turned to Spall, and the smile  disappeared. Looking away, it struggled against the swaddling, yawned, made a  noise that might have been a fart and subsided into sleep again.</p>
    <p>Lakh grimaced. &ldquo;If there's killing to be done, you'll have  to do it yourself, Inspector, or find a man without heart or conscience. There  isn't a cook in the kitchen who wouldn't rather be chastised, demoted, or even  expelled.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I can't say I blame them,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;By the way, is  there anything in that recipe that corresponds to the word <em>erkin</em>?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<em>Erkin</em>, Inspector? Lakh poked through the instruction  sheet. &ldquo;It's not on the list.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Never mind, then. It's just that the Gost told me we lacked  sufficient <em>erkin</em> to make a proper <em>proschtl</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I've never heard of <em>erkin</em> before,&rdquo; said Lakh, &ldquo;but  if it's edible, we can make it, even if we have to synthesize it. But as I  said, the word <em>erkin</em> does not appear in the recipe, or in the  instructions for the <em>zenproschten</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall sighed and wiped sweat from his brow. He couldn't  bring himself to blame the chefs, and there was no question of preparing the <em>proschtl</em> himself. He would need time to think this over.</p>
    <p align="center">lll</p>
    <p>That evening, after the cheese plate, Spall brought the problem  of <em>proschtl</em> to the attention of the Cellar-General, a salty old man who  had earned his <em>Fourchette </em>some sixty years ago. Half an hour later they  were standing in the stockyard, by the <em>proscht</em> cage. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Unbelievable,&rdquo; said the Cellar General. &ldquo;It's quite simply  unbelievable. Look at the way your flashlight reflects off its skin. Are you  thinking what I'm thinking?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall nodded. &ldquo;It's the only answer that fits, Sir. We've  only seen one Meidr, the one that declared war on us, but I'm pretty sure it  looked like a larger version of <em>that</em>.&rdquo; Spall indicated the sleeping <em>proscht</em>. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Then where the hell did the Gost get it?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;According to Chef Lakh,&rdquo; replied Spall, &ldquo;the provenance is  clear – it was delivered to us from the Gost Interchange and travelled here under  supervision on the <em>Deep-Jump</em> <em>InToStella</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Cellar General's knees creaked as he bent down to look  closer.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Open the cage, Spall. Is it dangerous?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I don't think so, Sir. Not any more than one of our own.  The cooks have been entering the cage every few hours to clean and feed it. So  far there have been no reports of injury.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall undid the latch and reached in to grasp the swaddling  board. Its occupant sighed sleepily as the tiny bed was dragged across the dirt  to the cage door. The Cellar General reached out, picked the <em>proscht</em> up  in his hands and slowly stood straight again. He examined the little body at  arm's length, then up close. The <em>proscht</em> stirred, struggled, and made a  noise like a cry. The Cellar General looked startled, then his features  softened and he cradled the <em>proscht</em> in the crook of his arm, with its  head just under his chin.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Spall, I heard what you said, and of course I believe you,  but I'm still having a hard time believing that the Gost eat their enemy's  children. Bring your nose over here – it even smells like a baby.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I wouldn't know, Sir,&rdquo; replied Spall, holding his hand up  to fend off the <em>proscht</em>. &ldquo;My experience of children is limited. And  besides, I don't <em>want </em>to know that it smells like a baby, because  CultSynch's directions are clear: the <em>proschtl</em> must be served.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Cellar-General shook his head. &ldquo;We need more  information, Spall. Let's return to my office, remove the poor little thing  from this instrument of torture, and take a proper look at its anatomy. I don't  know about you,&rdquo; he added, softly, &ldquo;but I couldn't kill one of these, any more  than I could kill one of our own.&rdquo;</p>
    <p align="center">IV</p>
    <p>Commander Hornbill at CultSynch had a sharp, no-nonsense  attitude that perfectly matched the sour expression on his smug, handsome face.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The <em>proschtl</em> is made from Meidr babies? That doesn't  sound likely.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Granted,&rdquo; said the Cellar-General. &ldquo;It makes a lousy  proposition, but there it is. It's a baby, and it looks strikingly like the  image we saw of the Meidr. It appears to be personable and intelligent, but  we're supposed to kill it and cook it. Frankly, Commander, we don't know what  to do.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;Nor do I,&rdquo; said Hornbill. &ldquo;These allegations are very  inspecific. Frankly, it sounds like your entire department has come down with  the collywobbles.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I assure you, Sir,&rdquo; said the Cellar-General, &ldquo;that the  collywobbles are not a factor.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; said Hornbill, &ldquo;you're operating with  an insufficiency of information. If I were you I would take counsel from the  BookWorms.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;That could take days,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;At least give us High  Access.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Hornbill scowled. &ldquo;With the Meidr coming, Inspector, Access  is in extremely high demand. Quite frankly, in the absence of corroborative  evidence, CultSynch is unable to help. This is a catering issue, Cellar-General,  and I speak for the entire human race when I tell you that the <em>proschtl</em> must be served.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Access screen went black and the Cellar-General turned  to Spall.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;And there we go. That's about what I expected.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; asked Spall.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Clenna Pfade of the Bookworms might be able to help us, but  every time we go for assistance to another department we lose face. We're only  VisHosp, and VisHosp is just service, so our problems, by definition, are  insignificant, and so, by extension, are we. Except that they're not, and we're  not. Listen, Spall, forget the BookWorms. Let's try our own research  department.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall looked puzzled. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;You mean Recipes?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yes, I mean Recipes,&rdquo; snapped the Cellar-General. &ldquo;And  don't stand there with that puzzled look on your face. Emma Tang may not be a  BookWorm, but she's a smart young woman with a broad understanding of  intergalactic customs. In addition, I seem to remember that she had children of  her own before joining the Brotherhood. See what she thinks of this...<em>proschtl</em> ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Cellar-General looked at the squirming <em>proscht</em> and motioned peremptorily to Spall. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;I know you're not comfortable with babies, but this is  work. Take it to Emma Tang and see if she can help. And remember, if word of  this gets around it will put the negotiations in jeopardy. Be discrete, be  efficient, be gone.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      Spall stood a moment, reverberating irresolutely in the  aftermath of his dismissal, anger and confusion alternately draining and  suffusing his features of blood. Then he sighed, scooped up the Meidr infant,  bowed, and left the Cellar-General's office, turning towards the basement  stairs and the dark underground office of the Recipes Department.</p>
    <p align="center">V</p>
    <p>Emma Tang raised a supercilious eyebrow and looked down her  long nose, through which issued an almost-equine snort of incredulity. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;That's a weird-looking baby. It's a blue, shiny-skinned,  weird-eared baby.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;That much, in my capacity as  Inspector, I've managed to ascertain.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>There was a pause. Then: &ldquo;Seriously? You're asking me for a  recipe for baby?&rdquo; Emma Tang's eyebrows arched so high that Spall had to choke  back a smile.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said Spall, easing off, just a little. &ldquo;In  fact, we already have a recipe for baby. I was wondering if you could take a  look at it and...comment.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;You want me to comment on a recipe for baby? You're going  to cook this...poor little blue baby? You can't be serious.&rdquo; Spall had worn the  edge off her hauteur – she sounded almost plaintive.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I wish I weren't,&rdquo; sighed Spall. He handed her the recipe  that Chef Lakh had given him. &ldquo;This was presented to VisHosp as the recipe for <em>proschtl</em>.  The main ingredient is <em>proscht</em>, which you see before you. As you  noticed, it looks a lot like a human baby, but its skin is reflective and its  ears are distinctly alien. From what we saw during the Meidr's Declaration of  war, we think it's one of them.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Emma leaned forward and sniffed. &ldquo;It smells like a human  baby.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;So I've been told,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;I've also been told that  we need to slaughter it for the <em>proschtl</em>, to ensure a treaty with the  Gost and protect the future of humanity.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Well I guess if you have to,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;I mean, it's not  human, so it's not exactly cannibalism. If it's intelligent, though, it's still  murder. Don't ask me to do the cooking.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;That's the other part of the problem,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;What  I'm about to tell you is a Level One Confidence.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Nothing is mine to give away,&rdquo; murmured Emma.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Then brace yourself, because this isn't pretty. It's called  a <em>zenproschten</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>When Spall had finished relating the preparation process for <em>proschtl</em>, Emma Tang sat back in her chair and scowled. &ldquo;That doesn't  sound right. It's...barbaric.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Spall with a nod. &ldquo;It's callous and seemingly  primitive. Is there a single recipe for a ceremonial dinner in the culinary  repertoire of any intergalactic civilization that involves eating the infants  of an intelligent species?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Not in my experience,&rdquo; said Emma. She crossed her legs, and  for a quarter second all Spall could hear was the sound of fabric sliding  across her thighs. &ldquo;But I can't answer you for sure. We know almost nothing  about what goes on outside our solar system.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall's fingers formed a steeple, the tip of his index  fingers just touching the tip of his nose. Despite his initial reaction to Emma  she was beginning to shake his head out of the clouds. &ldquo;An entire universe out  there, and we know next to nothing about it. The Visitors have complete Access  to our libraries, but if we want to investigate the origins of the <em>zenproschten</em> we can suck eggs.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Don't let Audit catch you,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;Every egg we get up  here costs thirty units to transport.&rdquo; While Spall had been talking she'd  opened a new enquiry. &ldquo;Damn it, if I could get even a millisecond of Access I  might be able to.... This is important, right?&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;The Gost won't sign a treaty without proschtl,&rdquo; said Spall.  &ldquo;Therefore the proschtl must be served or earth will have no ally.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Emma stared at him a long moment. &ldquo;And it's down to us? Here  in the basement of VisHosp?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall grimaced, then leaned forward towards Emma and lowered  his voice. &ldquo;The Cellar-General talked to CultSynch. CultSynch said it's a  catering problem.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I wish that surprised me,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;But it doesn't. When  it comes to bureaucratic myopia CultSynch takes the entire fucking cake.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I'd forgotten about the cake,&rdquo; said Spall.</p>
    <p>Emma looked puzzled. &ldquo;What cake?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall looked around a moment, then decided to sit. &ldquo;I don't  think it has any bearing. Except, perhaps, in a peripheral fashion. &ldquo;What's  bothering me is something the Gost said. It may be entirely irrelevant, but he  implied that if humans <em>were </em>to travel outside our solar system, we  should do so on the basis of cake. He dismissed everything we do as simple or  trite...except for cake.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Well we do make good cakes,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;At least there's  something special about us. And besides, you're in the cake business yourself,  you know, if only peripherally.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I suppose you're right,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;But...<em>cake</em>?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Emma shrugged. &ldquo;Why not? Better that than <em>proschtl</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Emma turned back to her Access panel, entered a Recipe  Department high-priority demand code, and hardly had time to pout her lips into  an expectant mouee before the information she'd requested was up on the screen.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;There was something like the <em>zenproschten</em> in ancient  France,&rdquo; she summarized. &ldquo;They called it a duck press. The duck was strangled  to keep the blood inside the body. After it was roasted, the breasts and legs  were removed and the rest of the carcass was put in the press, along with wine,  cognac, and a variety of optional ingredients. The fluids, and by fluids I mean  blood and bone marrow, were squeezed out to make a sauce. It's a variation of  the same process used in the making of <em>proschtl</em>, don't you think?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Similar,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;But I'm not sure that tells us  anything.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;It  tells us one thing,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;Historically, we had a similar  food-preparation process,<br>
      but  it didn't survive the 21st century. We outgrew it,  the same way we outgrew torture and war.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;What does that tell us?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Some emotional reactions are inherent and axiomatic,&rdquo; said  Emma, &ldquo;and the Gost aren't idiots. I'd put money on them knowing that <em>proschtl</em> is contrary to both our social conditioning and our biological instincts. In my  opinion, for what that's worth, we're either being tested or teased.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; sighed Spall. &ldquo;That's more-or-less the idea  that's been trying to form in my head all day. But why would they do it? And  why would they value the actions of VisHosp, which, let's face it, doesn't  exactly represent the pinnacle of human achievement.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Maybe that's it,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;Maybe they want to test us in  the middle of the curve. Or maybe they really do consider cake the pinnacle of  human achievement.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall sat silent a moment as the implications sank in. &ldquo;I  think you're right. It must be a test. And not just the <em>proschtl</em>. Why  restrict your logic regarding scientific achievement and civilization to the  Gost? Perhaps we should be asking why the Meidr declared war on us in the first  place.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;It makes even less sense than the <em>proschtl</em>. Could a people advanced enough to build galaxy-class  technology still engage in wars of conquest? What's the motivation? And why  wouldn't the other races join together to shut them down?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; said Spall, &ldquo;you're making some dangerous  assumptions. And yet...&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;And yet what?&rdquo; huffed Emma.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Can you access the Meidr declaration of war?&rdquo; </p>
    <p>&ldquo;I can try,&rdquo; she replied. Emma turned to Access and tapped  her fingers across the board. An image appeared. In the foreground was a small  blue man, sitting in what was clearly the captain's chair of an alien vessel.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We are the Meidr,&rdquo; said the image on the screen. &ldquo;We come  from the eleventh planet of a star for which you have  no name or number.&rdquo; He snapped his fingers  and the orange globe of an unknown planet filled a screen behind his head. &ldquo;In  several months we will reach your solar system.&rdquo; The blue man smiled  beatifically and bowed. &ldquo;Please consider this a declaration of war.&rdquo; The transmission  ended.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Short, concise and polite,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;It hardly seems  like a declaration of war at all. There's no weight to it, no reason, no  gravitas.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;No <em>human</em> gravitas,&rdquo; replied Emma. &ldquo;Perhaps if we  were Meidr or Gost we'd be pissing ourselves in terror.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I suppose that's true,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;But we're still left  with the same basic problem – what could the Meidr want from us that would be  worth travelling all the way from...wherever they come from?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall happened to be looking at Emma's eyes, and watched  with detachment as her lids flicked open and her pupils dilated with fear.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;What if....&rdquo; Emma hunched over the desk and lowered her  voice. &ldquo;What if they're planning to eat us?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall chuckled and shook his head. &ldquo;I doubt it. Not if this  infant is any reflection of the adult Meidr. Its diet consists of carbon-based  analogues of our grains, fruits and vegetables. Its gut is doubled, like a  ruminant's, and its grinding apparatus, which I hesitate to call teeth, is not  even remotely evolved for meat.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>They spent a moment looking at the sleeping Meidr, which  rolled and mewled and waved its arms in contrary motion. Its stomach quaked,  and the room filled with the sharp smell of hay.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Which part of the stockyard does that remind you of?&rdquo; asked  Spall, dryly.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The barn,&rdquo; admitted Emma. She picked the Meidr infant up  and snuggled it to her chest. &ldquo;Even if he weren't a vegetarian, I'd have a  problem imagining this little butterball as a killer. In fact,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I  think he's more of a lover than a fighter.&rdquo; The infant, Spall noted, had  rotated in her arms, and was making sucking noises with its mouth as it spread  its finger-palps across her breast.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Perhaps the Meidr breastfeed?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;What are they, then? Little blue alien mammals?&rdquo; Emma  looked sceptical.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Why not? This one has roughly mammalian genitals.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Well they don't look anything like my mammalian genitals,&rdquo;  said Emma. &ldquo;And if he's looking for milk, he sure won't find any here.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We could induce lactation chemically,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;As  a...cross-species culinary experiment.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Emma stared at him coldly. &ldquo;If you're being lubricious,  Inspector, I might remind you that we already have an inter-special culinary  experiment on our hands. Perhaps one is enough for the moment?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall smiled guiltily. &ldquo;I apologize. To tell the truth, I'm  exhausted. I've been going all day on a bowlful of Rise. If you don't have  plans, would you like to come back to my cubicle for dinner?&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;Why not stay here?&rdquo; Emma reached behind her to pull a cord  which released a drape that hid a comfortable cubicle with bed, toilet and  kitchen. &ldquo;I have norwits, shu-shu, and, if you promise to tell absolutely no  one, a bottle of Frizz. They are, if anybody asks, <em>ingredients</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Norwits, shu-shu and Frizz? I should  have been in Recipes. I suppose I ought to report you for Sequestering, but  frankly I'd rather have dinner.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Food and rules are a terrible mix,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;Abandon all  honour, ye who wish to be fed. Now if you're serious about wanting to be in Recipes,  uncork the Frizz and pour me a glass – you might just get your wish.&rdquo;</p>
    <p align="center">Vl</p>
    <p>The Recipes department, it turned out, was the haven of  excellent chefs – none more-so than Emma. All the same, when Spall woke up the  next morning, it was not the memory of supper that put a smile on his face. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;I'm glad you're awake,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;The baby needs  changing.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall's smile faded. &ldquo;Changing?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Changing,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;As in...his diaper. I did it last  night; it's your turn this morning.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>Spall's expression slumped further. Emma sat up in bed and  growled at him sleepily. &ldquo;Have a shower. Take him with you. Don't get Kleen in  his eyes. Towels in the cupboard by the shower.&rdquo; She fell back and pulled the  covers over her head. &ldquo;If you have any mercy you'll wake me up in half-an-hour  with a cup of Rise.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall took the Meidr to the shower, gingerly removed its  diaper with one hand, dropped the soiled nappy in the sanispose and turned the  water on. The Meidr lay on its back and cooed. </p>
    <p>Spall washed his body with Kleen, and his hair with Shine.  As he lathered up his tonsure he felt the Meidr's palps on his ankle. Spall  tried to open his right eye, but thick sheets of Shine were dripping off his  eyebrow. He shut his eye against the sting, and felt the Meidr's little fingers  on his knee. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Hey little fellow,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;Careful there!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>There was the sound of something moving quickly through the  air, then a slap and a yelp. A moment later Spall slumped to the tiles in slow  motion, his hands cupping his groin.</p>
    <p>Emma appeared in the door of the shower.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Did you fall?&rdquo;<br>
      Spall shook his head. &ldquo;He punched me. The little fucker  punched me. Right in the god-damned balls.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Emma's eyebrows arched in disbelief. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>She abandoned the sheet she was wearing and stepped into the  shower.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You think he meant to?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I think <em>it</em> may not be as cute as <em>it</em> looks,&rdquo;  said Spall. He stood up and left the shower, still hunched, leaving Emma to  watch after him as he walked past the towels and dripped water across the  cubicle.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Hey! What are you doing?&rdquo; she cried. But it wasn't Spall  she addressed, it was the Meidr, who had reached up with its chubby blue hand  and firmly squeezed her labia...almost, she thought, with <em>intention</em>.</p>
    <p align="center">Vll</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Greetings, Important Guest,&rdquo; said Spall to Ten-prime, who  was just entering the banquet room, his bellows-laden Annunciator trailing  silently behind. &ldquo;Your presence is requested in the Visitor Education Centre  for an important conversation. It will take only a moment, after which luncheon  will be served.&rdquo; Ten-prime waggled his <em>vens</em> with what appeared to be  good grace and followed Spall through the doors and down the hall.</p>
    <p>Emma was waiting for them. In front of her, on a table, was  the Meidr infant, rebound to its swaddling board, along with a complete silver  dinner service, and, of course, the <em>zenproschten </em>and its associated sack  of <em>stril</em>.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;This is my colleague, Emma Tang,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;She serves  as VisHosp's Master of Recipes.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Gost motioned to the Annunciator, who commenced to pump  air through the Gost's <em>vens</em>.<br>
      &ldquo;It is an honour to meet a Master of Recipes,&rdquo; wheezed the  Gost. &ldquo;Food and information are universal mediums of exchange. Your mind will  take you many exceptional places, when your species ventures outside your solar  system.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;One day we hope to,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;At the moment, however,  our concerns are closer to home.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Home is where the <em>vens </em>are,&rdquo; hissed Ten-prime,  enigmatically. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;This concerns the matter of <em>proschtl</em>,&rdquo; continued  Spall<em>.</em> &ldquo;I have been tasked with overseeing its successful implementation.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You are a chef?&rdquo; asked the Gost.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I am an inspector,&rdquo; replied Spall. &ldquo;I identify problems  with food service and offer solutions. To that end I am trained as a chef, a  waiter, and as an effectuator. The <em>proschtl</em>, as I think you may be  aware, is very difficult for humans to effectuate.&rdquo;<br>
      &ldquo;How can this be?&rdquo; wheezed the Gost. &ldquo;Everything has been  supplied, including the <em>proscht</em>.&rdquo; Ten-prime waved every second <em>vens</em> at the chubby blue baby, who, thought Spall, appeared to be holding its breath. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;The problem,&rdquo; said Spall, &ldquo;is that none of us is willing to  harm the <em>proscht</em>, for three inter-related reasons. One, there is a  pronounced physical resemblance between the <em>proscht</em> and ourselves, which  automatically triggers our universal interdiction against cannibalism. Two, we  believe the <em>proscht</em> to be intelligent, which adds fuel to our malaise.  Three, the proscht looks, smells and acts much like a human baby, which  triggers our parenting instincts. For a time we considered contracting the  slaughter out, but even that challenges the limits of our moral sensibilities.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Gost stared long and hard at Spall before responding. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Your glands and secretions drive you to folly, human. But  in truth, it doesn't matter anymore.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It matters to Earth,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;Earth needs an alliance  with the Gost to fight the Meidr.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Gost made a series of strange wheezes. &ldquo;No need, human.  The time for war has passed already.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Passed?&rdquo; said Spall. The meeting, so carefully planned with  Emma in the small hours of the morning, was being inexorably wrenched out of  his control.</p>
    <p>The Gost pointed its <em>vens</em> towards the swaddling  board. &ldquo;Yes, the time for war has past. The time for celebration has arrived. I  will tell you something of <em>proschtl </em>now. Celebration is the real time  for <em>proschtl,</em> and now is the time to celebrate<em>. </em>Inspector Spall,  Recipe Master Tang, if you would sit, we have much to do before the <em>proschtl</em> is served.&rdquo;</p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center">Vlll</p>
    <p>Spall watched Emma sit, wondering why she was so quick to  obey the Gost's presumptuous command. The irony struck him a moment later, when  he realized that he too was sitting, and tried, but could not stand. Although  his mind was clear, his body was not his to command.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;There is nothing to fear.&rdquo; wheezed the Gost. &ldquo;No harm is  meant, no harm will come. I have folded the fulcrum of your volitionary  processes into an orthogonal dimension. I will realign them once the <em>proschtl</em> has been served. Yes, Inspector, I intuit your doubt, but we must work while we  talk. Miss Tang, would you kindly unwrap the <em>proscht</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>While Emma worked, the Gost continued talking. &ldquo;It astounds  you that other species are comfortable in dimensions that you have barely yet  conceptualized. Abandon astonishment, humans. Once you have studied the control  units that govern the star engine you will understand the equations that  balance dimensionality, <em>erkin</em>, and mind. For the moment, however, you  haven't a clue, which is why you are stuck.&rdquo; The Gost made a horrible hissing  noise and his <em>vens</em> wiggled with wild abandon. Spall watched Emma unwrapping  the <em>proscht</em>. She moved with dreamy vagueness, her face blank, except for  her eyes, which were opened wide and staring at Spall. He tried to blink at  her, but couldn't.</p>
    <p>Emma finished unswaddling the <em>proscht.</em> It lay on its  back on the table, kicking its legs and gurgling.  </p>
    <p>&ldquo;What a delectable looking <em>proscht</em>,&rdquo; wheezed  Ten-prime. &ldquo;Would you like to meet its mother?&rdquo; As the Gost spoke, all of its <em>vens</em> leaned sideways and down, pointing towards the diminutive Annunciator as it sat  on the floor working the bellows. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Inspector Spall, Recipe-Master Tang, allow me to introduce  the Meidr.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>Spall jumped, or he would have, had he been able. Was this  an invasion? Had the <em>proscht</em> been nothing but a diversion? He screamed  at himself to call for help, but his voice would not respond.</p>
    <p>The Annunciator stood up, handed the bellows to Ten-prime,  and doffed his hooded cloak to reveal a chubby blue body, identical in nearly  every respect to the <em>proscht</em>, but twice as large. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Pleased to meet you,&rdquo; said the Meidr with a bow. &ldquo;Although  in all honesty, it's you who should be pleased to meet me. I will give you your  voice back, Inspector, but not enough to call for help.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>Spall felt something release, and knew that he could talk  again. &ldquo;You betrayed us,&rdquo; he said to Ten-prime.</p>
    <p>Half the Gost's <em>vens </em>had wrapped themselves around  the handle of the bellows and were lazily turning the crank.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;How is that possible,&rdquo; wheezed the Gost, &ldquo;when no treaty  has been signed? I did not betray you, human, but we have certainly...what's that  lovely word...<em>bamboozled</em> you.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Since you represented yourself falsely,&rdquo; said Spall, &ldquo;this  counts as a betrayal, not a bamboozle. You have helped the Meidr invade us –  this will put us at war with both your species.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You misunderstand,&rdquo; interrupted the Meidr. &ldquo;There are no  species called Gost, or Meidr. We are the Gost and the Meidr – instances of  singularity; <em>hapax legomenon</em>! Furthermore, human, the war was over the  minute your chefs began to sentimentalize the <em>proscht.</em> While you spent  your time distracted by morality, the Gost and I have plundered your planet's  most intimate commodity!In the last two days we have stolen as much of  your precious <em>erkin </em>as our mighty <em>thrums</em> can hold!&rdquo; </p>
    <p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; cried Spall in a whisper. &ldquo;How can we  appreciate your cleverness when we don't know what we've lost?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Meidr's face assumed an even craftier expression. &ldquo;That,  my dear human, is why it was easy to steal. Usually our ventures take  significant lengths of time, not to mention machinery, energy, and legions of  complicit entities. But not here. Here all we needed was this.&rdquo; The Meidr  smiled as he pulled the infant off the table and dropped it on the floor. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Don't...&rdquo; said Emma, somehow forcing the words out through  locked teeth. &ldquo;Don't...hurt...that...baby.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>The Meidr looked at her and grinned as he opened the <em>zenproschten</em> and began to ready the pans for use. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Please relax,&rdquo; said the Gost, using his <em>vens</em> to pump  his own bellows. &ldquo;The Meidr is not hurting anyone. The <em>proscht</em> is more  like a fruit than an entity. It buds from the Meidr's fructifer, ripens, and  becomes ready to eat. If not eaten when ready, it rots. This <em>proscht</em> is  ready to eat. It is a symbol of our victory and your loss. Dismiss your  misguided qualms and prepare yourself for an experience.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>As Ten-prime talked, the Meidr kneeled on the <em>proscht</em> and pushed <em>stril </em>into its flesh. It struggled, and uttered a series of  plangent cries. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Now we must wait,&rdquo; said the Meidr. &ldquo;I will slow time down  in this room, but speed time up for the <em>proscht</em>. In that way the <em>stril</em> will have time to flavour the meat, and the Gost and I will not have  interminable frustration discussing our knowledge with humans.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Meidr infant (or Meidr <em>fruit</em>, thought Spall)  began to wave its arms and kick furiously, like a segment of sped-up film. Then  it stopped, and the Meidr was speaking again.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The <em>proscht</em> must be alive while the <em>stril</em> is  administered. Its reaction to the heat distributes the flavour through the  meat.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We call it The Noble Dance,&rdquo; wheezed the Gost. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;It struggles,&rdquo; whispered Emma, with tears on her cheeks.  &ldquo;It's in pain.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Do fruit feel pain?&rdquo; replied the Meidr, gracing Emma with a  withering glance. &ldquo;Do you worry about every little plum you rip between your  teeth?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You're lying,&rdquo; whispered Spall. &ldquo;This morning in the  shower, the <em>proscht</em> attacked me and caressed Recipe-Master Tang. There  was a clear feeling of willfulness – of intention. How could a piece of fruit  have intention?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Meidr laughed. &ldquo;The <em>proscht</em>'s mind is an empty  house filled with comfortable chairs. Call it...my home away from home.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Emma's face suffused with blood, perhaps from embarrassment,  perhaps from rage, perhaps from both.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You...little...blue...pervert.&rdquo;</p>
    <p> &ldquo;That's quite enough  of that,&rdquo; said the Meidr, waving a digit at Emma, who grew suddenly silent.  &ldquo;Besides, it's time to continue your education in the noble art of <em>proschtl</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall and Emma looked on, helpless, as the Meidr pulled a  rope from a point in space and passed it around the infant's neck. The infant  made a comical face as the rope was drawn tight, then it convulsed a moment and  lay still.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Do you see?&rdquo; said the Meidr. &ldquo;That's all you had to do. If  you'd done it right away, you'd have lost much less <em>erkin</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We didn't know the rules,&rdquo; whispered Spall. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;There are no rules,&rdquo; said the Meidr. &ldquo;Only sweet <em>erkin </em>–  its possession, and loss. Now then – it's time for the <em>zenproschten</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The <em>zenproschten </em>was disassembled and the <em>proscht</em> laid inside, head and feet protruding. A boss on the side was pressed and the <em>zenproschten</em> gently pulsed with a soft white radiation. Somewhere deep in its  machinery a heart began to beat, and with  each tick of that alien heart the metal pans could be heard to constrict, and  with each tightening came the sound of fluids trickling through lacework  grilles. </p>
    <p>The Meidr played his time tricks again, and within a few  subjective moments Spall and Emma could smell the <em>proschtl</em> roasting. The  small blue head and feet soon wilted and lost their colour. As the <em>zenproschten</em> contracted, they could hear the juices spit and sizzle as they dripped into the  warming tray. Soon, the head separated from the body and fell to the floor. The  feet followed. The Meidr picked them up, held them out towards Spall and shook  them.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Always keep the pits,&rdquo; said the Meidr. &ldquo;We save them to  feed the <em>veedz.</em>&rdquo; For a moment he looked serious. &ldquo;Never cross dimensions  without something for the <em>veedz</em>.&rdquo; The Gost waggled his <em>vens</em> in  agreement.</p>
    <p>Emma was staring at the Meidr and making muffled sounds with  her throat.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Meidr, and waved his digit, again.</p>
    <p>Emma sighed and sniffed the air. &ldquo;I still don't like this.  But it does smell good.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; wheezed the Gost. &ldquo;The mere smell of <em>proschtl</em> can be life-changing. By my reckoning, it should be ready.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Meidr waved his palps and time reverted to its familiar  order. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the Gost. &ldquo;Allow me to serve.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>The <em>vens </em>elongated, lowered from the Gost's head, and  worked with terrifying speed and precision to release the sprung pans of the <em>zenproschten</em>.  The <em>proschtl</em> rolled out, onto a cutting board, steaming hot and cobalt  blue. Several <em>vens </em>wrapped around a pair of knives and began to carve.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Only a little for me,&rdquo; said Emma Tang.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the Meidr. &ldquo;You will never have <em>proschtl</em> again.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The <em>vens</em> were done – the meat was carved in  bite-sized cubes and stacked in tiny ziggurats on four Delft-VisHosp plates.  The Meidr thumbed a silver hammer and the drip tray unhinged from the bottom of  the <em>zenproschten</em>. The juices, thick, blue and pungent, were collected in  a boat, then poured atop the ziggurats of <em>proschtl</em>.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Dig in,&rdquo; said the Meidr.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We use our fingers...or our <em>vens</em>,&rdquo; said the Gost,  &ldquo;as the case may be.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spall and Emma shared a glance, each hesitant to be the  first to feed. Then Emma raised a fatalistic eyebrow and tossed a gobbet of <em>proschtl</em> into her mouth. Spall watched the expression change on her face, from suspicion  to wonder.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Do it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just do it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>So he did.</p>
    <p>And the universe began to unfold. Somewhere in front of him,  where previously there had been nothing, there was now the perception of a  corner, demanding to be looked around. It was a complex corner, not built from  single facets, but from the angles of an infinitude of other corners, each of  which was likewise constituted of other corners, and so on, down to the  smallest scale imaginable, and all of them demanding to be looked around. Above  and around him, Spall became aware of larger corners, looming over him, ranging  in size from frightening, to monstrous, to scales of unfathomable complexity.  Spall blinked his eyes and shook his head, aware that shock and vertigo were  gathering their forces in an assault against his mind.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We hope you like it,&rdquo; said the Gost. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;They ought to,&rdquo; growled the Meidr. &ldquo;It's jam-packed with <em>erkin</em>.  While you're there, human, take a look around the corner.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You naughty Meidr,&rdquo; said the Gost, but it was too late.  Spall had peeked around the corner, and found himself peeking around an  infinite number of corners, to as many views as there are points in the  universe, simultaneously, without filter, his usual sense of caution, of  identity, long-forgotten points in an infinite array of unknowable coordinates,  each its own corner, each beckoning, each telling him: &ldquo;Here you are, good for  you, but there's one more corner to look around....&rdquo; HIs mind, mercifully, shut  down. The Gost used his <em>vens</em> to catch Spall's body as he slumped,  unconscious, to the floor. The Meidr did nothing to help poor Emma Tang, who  had also looked around the corner into everywhere.</p>
    <p>The Meidr sighed.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Weak minds,&rdquo; he said. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;But very good cake,&rdquo; replied the Gost.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I will lower the inflammation,&rdquo; said the Meidr.</p>
    <p>He placed two digits on each human forehead. For a moment  small blue lines of energy danced between the palps, then Spall and Emma woke.  For a moment they lay where they were, reconciling the profundity of their  visions to the fact that they now felt relaxed and calm.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Thank-you?&rdquo; said Emma. She sounded, thought Spall, like a  child with a gift she was too young to understand.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It's how you travel, isn't it,&rdquo; said Spall.</p>
    <p>The Meidr stood up, stepped towards Spall and held out his  hand, as though to be shaken. Spall reached out with his own hand, but found  himself grasping, not flesh, but a smooth, heavy scroll. </p>
    <p>The Meidr grinned, exposing his oddly shaped grinders.  &ldquo;Consolation, human. For the loss of your <em>erkin</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Meidr reached out and tapped the scroll, which snapped  flat and extended thin legs to the ground. Spall looked down, to see a  three-dimensional diagram form above the surface, as silver and protean as  mercury, a wild confusion of rotors, rods, flanges, volutes, vanes,  columnators, cams, and a bewildering variety of arcane instrumentation.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; said the Meidr. &ldquo;Consolation.&rdquo; He reached over again  to tap a section of the diagram, which expanded into a blue detail of the part  chosen.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Again!&rdquo; said the Meidr. He tapped a section of the expanded  detail, causing an instant expansion of the sub-section, this time in green.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Again!&rdquo; he repeated. He tapped a section of the  sub-section, which expanded to reveal a fractal tesseract in an ethereal shade  of violet.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;More corners,&rdquo; said Emma.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yes. More corners. And also, consolation, for your <em>erkin</em>,&rdquo;  repeated the Meidr.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;That's very kind,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;But I'm not sure I  understand.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Meidr laughed. &ldquo;Here. I will show you.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      He waved his palps above the diagrams and symbols appeared;  a script unknown to Spall. </p>
    <p>Ten-prime moved over to the scroll and snapped two <em>vens</em>.  The letters changed, from Meidr-script to earth.</p>
    <p>Spall looked down at the scroll like a man teetering at the  top of a bottomless pit; his guts roiled, and his blood hammered so loudly in  his ears that the room around him began to spin. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Our business is done,&rdquo; said the Meidr. He waved his small blue  digits and disappeared, leaving evanescent swirls of black and white tessarae  in the space formerly occupied by his body.</p>
    <p>Spall was trying to find the strength to keep his knees from  collapsing. A vigorous shake of his head allowed him to blink away the  impending blackness and draw a breath. He shook and blinked again, opening his  eyes wide, doing his best to encompass the meaning of the three spare syllables  before him: <em>STAR ENGINE</em>. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Use this well,&rdquo; said Ten-prime. &ldquo;It is not a gift. You have  unwittingly compensated us with a bounty of excellent <em>erkin</em>. Ten-prime  waggled his <em>vens</em> and seemed to bow. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;But why us?&rdquo; begged Spall. &ldquo;Why not the head of CultSynch,  or the Aesthetes, or the Scientistes? This is Victualling.... We're not  qualified – we're not...worthy.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You will find,&rdquo; said Ten-prime, &ldquo;that the only novel things  your species can offer the universe are elements of your cuisine. Your machines  are basic. Your arts are primitive. Your thoughts are backwards and simple. But  your cooking is quite original, especially your cakes. In time, given the will,  victualling will become your greatest source of commerce and diplomacy.  Logically, then, it is the Victuallers who should own the star engine.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;They'll never let us,&rdquo; said Spall. &ldquo;They'll take it away.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Finish your <em>proschtl</em>,&rdquo; said Ten-prime. &ldquo;Finish it,  and we will see who will do what to whom. The Meidr and I go elsewhere now, to  steal some other planet's <em>erkin</em>. When we return to Earth it will be for  cake, and, if you haven't learned to use it properly, more of your <em>erkin</em>.  Until then, humans, we bid you <em>adieu</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Ten-prime's <em>vens</em> turned a shade of pale blue and  throbbed three times with spiralling coruscation of purple and orange. He  picked up his plate and disappeared, following the Meidr around  inter-dimensional corners as yet untraveled by Emma and Spall, who stood silent  a moment after they were alone – confused, excited, scared, but hungry for  another bite of <em>proschtl</em>.</p>
