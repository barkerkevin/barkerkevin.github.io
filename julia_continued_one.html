    <p>      JULIA FELT SAFE at the river and went often, for the mission was close, and the town was far enough from Bahia to escape the danger of the roads. At the bend it widened into a jade pool under a canopy of Reina del Noche, and she liked to paddle her feet there.<br>
      &quot;Where are your shoes?&quot; asked Lygia.<br>
      &quot;I don't know. Somewhere there.&quot; A breeze lifted the branches of the Pichote trees and brought the scent of the Reina to her.<br>
      &quot;You're always losing them. Why don't you lose that old calico dress instead...?&quot;<br>
      &quot;I like it,&quot; she said in Tupi.<br>
      &quot;Don't speak that, you know it's forbidden.&quot; But Lygia too spoke the pidgin tongue of the Jesuits. &quot;Say you love me you crazy girl, in Portuguese.&quot;<br>
      &quot;Eu te amo. Você fala Francais?&quot;<br>
      &quot;Não falo não.&quot;<br>
      &quot; ...listen!&quot;<br>
       The sound of voices, barely audible, began to rise over the shrill drone of the cicadas, and then the wheezing of oxen and creaking of wagons.<br>
    &quot;Oh, it's the peregrinos. Come!&quot;</p>
    <p><br>
       In the days before Semana Santa the pilgrims walked from their homes to São Franscisco in Salvadore de Bahia, for that was the tradition, and the greater the distance the more devout the pilgrim was for having made the journey. Julia and Lygia caught up with the slow oxen; they fell in step behind the swinging wooden carts of the boyeros, taking whatever shade they could find from the bamboo that grew over the road.<br>
      &quot;... and that boy you like - Jânio - what of him?&quot; said Julia.<br>
      &quot;What? I don't like any boy.<br>
      &quot;I saw him yesterday, the thief.&quot;<br>
      &quot;He's not!&quot;<br>
    &quot;He's stolen your heart.&quot;</p>
    <p>When they passed the mission Julia looked for Father Quadra on the steps and by the baroque fountain with the pale blue azuelas depicting the saints but she did not see him.<br>
      &quot;Your priest isn't there, <em>loca</em>. He's gone to Rome,&quot; whispered Lygia.<br>
      &quot;He hasn't.&quot;<br>
      &quot;Come.&quot;<br>
    She dragged Julia over to the drummers and the children who had been taught by the priests to sing the psalms in Tupi, and they passed the rest of the afternoon in this way, walking among the pilgrims bound for the Terreira de Jesus in old Bahia, until the big iron gate of her house appeared in the distance and grew larger with each step.</p>
    <p>&#8224;</p>
    <p>&quot;Where are your shoes?&quot; asked abuela from the kitchen.<br>
      &quot;At the river.&quot;<br>
    &quot;Aii, essas menina, eu não sei o que fazer com ela,&quot; said abuela, and sent Maria  to the river to fetch them, and the maid in turn went into the courtyard to dispatch Mario by horseback. Shoes and dresses were in short supply but the household still managed with the few loyal Creoles who had came from Martinique with Julia's father. The rest had made other arrangements in the town or in Bahia, or merely gone back to the hills where they'd come from. Many did in the early days of liberty, and returned again, but in the interval the plantations languished. The ships lay idle in the Bahia Todos os Santos for many weeks because the sugar harvests were poor, and some even left half empty. Julia saw them from the convent at Terreira de Jesus where she visited the nuns with Father Quadra. Their gunnels rode high above the opaque waters of the bay.</p>
    <p>The saints did not speak to Julia in the church of the Jesuit, though they sometimes appeared to her outside of them. Once Julia had gone with her family by ship to a tear-shaped island off the wild southern coast, where the red and green papagayos swooped out of the primeval forest against the chatter of a thousand white faced monkeys, and she had seen the face of the Virgin Mary in the emerald waves that folded over the vanishing tip of the land, and the Virgin spoke to her, as she did sometimes when Julia visited wild places. Julia wished to return someday but it was impossible without a ship and an escort because of the savages.<br>
  </p>
    <p>Julia's mother returned at last from her garden.      &quot;Father Quadra is here,&quot; she said, without further explanation.</p>
    <p>&quot;Aiiiii ... that priest,&quot; exclaimed abuela. &quot;Don't invite him in.&quot;<br>
      &quot;Come then,&quot; said her mother, and they went into the courtyard where Father Quadra greeted them warmly. <br>
    </p>
    <p>&quot;Tu foi na prefeitura?&quot;, abjuela asked him.<br>
    &quot;Si.&quot;</p>
    <p>They talked, Julia's abuela and the priest, and as as they did their tones fell, hushed. Yes, he had gone yesterday to the magistrate. It was true there had been an unfortunate scandal in Lisbon and the father confessor of the powerful House of Távora, a Jesuit, had been imprisoned. They talked at length, there in the courtyard where the night blooming hibiscus grew under Julia's bedroom window, and Father Quadra kept repeating, '<em>there is the question of the title, the lands are within the reduccion granted by the Spanish Crown'</em>. Soon others arrived through the wrought iron gate or from other parts of the house but kept their distance from the priest and abuela too, whom even the Portuguese merchants in the town called grandmother, for they were a little afraid of her, and they listened, and finally her abuela said, &quot;'these subjects, I do not know them well.&quot;<br>
