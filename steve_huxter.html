    <p>Steve Huxter worked at Sealand of the Pacific for 12 years from 1981 until its closing in 1992. For 8 of those years, he was head of the training and animal care dept. as well as the Victoria Marine Animal Rescue Centre, which was operated by Sealand of the Pacific. On Sealand’s closure in 1992 he bowed out from the animal training world and accepted a position managing Victoria’s most prominent marina and marine tourism business. As one of Tilikum’s former trainers at Sealand, Steve is featured in Gabriela Cowperthwaite’s award winning movie “Blackfish” - where he discusses a little of Tilikum’s history and the conditions that may have led up to Tili killing Keltie Byrne in February of 1991. After a ten year hiatus from working with animals, in 2003 he returned to his first calling and formed Transform Animal Behaviour Solutions. Steve now specializes in resolving severe behavioural disorders in companion animals, primarily dogs and cats.</p>

    <p>by Steve Huxter | <span style="font-size: 12px">7:30 p.m. January 16, 2014</span></p>
    <p>I was the first “trainer” to greet Tilikum when he arrived at Sealand of the Pacific.</p>
    <p>By the time he had been captured, detained and then flown to Victoria from Iceland, Tilikum had more experience interacting with humans than I had with orcas. He was covered, rostrum to fluke, with lanolin to protect his skin during the time he was out of the water, and after being lowered into the small pool that separated him from the two females who were to be his pool mates. Tilikum hesitatingly explored his new confines. As I watched him glide around the pool, I crouched at the water’s edge and encouraged him, a bucket of herring in my hand. I tapped the water’s surface with a fish and as he came close I tossed it in front of him. He scooped the fish into his mouth and came closer still. He stopped in front of me and raised his head, opening his mouth for more. I was taken aback. <br>
    </p>
    <div id="pull"> &quot;I came to know their distinct personalities and with each passing year my affections for them grew ...&quot;</div>
    <p>This creature had just been trapped and hung in a sling, slathered with goo, trucked, flown, trucked again, then lifted into the air and lowered into a tiny pool of water with concerned humans milling about and shouting to each other; yet… despite all this… he looked up at me and, seemingly, trusted. I was expecting distrust and hesitancy. It must have been an incredibly frightening journey, obviously perpetrated by people; yet he still trusted me. I couldn't say the same if our positions were reversed. It was a bonding experience and sparked in me a pilot light of empathy.</p>
    <p>From that moment and ever after, as much as I enjoyed Haida and Nootka; I always felt the most affection for Tilikum. </p>
    <p>Over the eight years I spent with Tilikum, Nootka and Haida, I came to know their distinct personalities and with each passing year my affections for them grew; especially for Tilikum. Perhaps it was that he was the “underdog” of the pool. There was something about him that touched my heart and the day that he was loaded onto a 747 cargo jet and shipped to Orlando my heart was broken that I would never see him again. </p>
    <p>I told myself that moving him to SeaWorld would mean that he would have a better life. I was wrong… terribly wrong. </p>
    <p>After Sealand closed I stepped, no, ran away from the industry and did my best to forget I was ever involved. I’d insulated myself for many years… until the death of Dawn Brancheau. Since then, and after meeting Gabriella Cowperthwaite (Director of “Blackfish”), I’ve been slowly coming to terms with my past and dropping my self-defensive leanings. </p>
    <p>As I’ve looked inward, what has puzzled me most is: How did I live a moral and ethical contradiction for 9 years and so effectively convince myself that I was doing no wrong? On one hand, I had learned and understood that the family structure of orcas was close and life-long. They have a complex intelligence and are wide ranging in their travels. They didn’t seem to live as long in captivity. Yet there I was, teaching three animals that had been torn from their families, shipped half way around the world and trapped in a cell, to do tricks for fish. <br>
      <br>
    Worse still, I spouted rationalizations to the public for their captivity and danced around the question of longevity. “That’s a good question little girl! We’re not sure how long they will live in an aquarium. And no one knows for sure how long they live in the wild. We haven’t been studying them for that many years.” </p>
    <p>If I loved and appreciated these magnificent animals so much; why would I lie, especially to myself? Why? The answer is quite simple; once I was honest with myself. Ego and selfishness [got in the way]. How many in the world can say: “I’m a killer whale trainer.” I pet, feed, play, work with one of the most magnificent and intelligent animals on the entire planet! The ego boost from an admiring public raised eyebrows and a “Really!!” expletive when you answer a person’s question about what you do for a living. And especially walking through a crowd after a performance; surrounded by the admiring expressions of adults and kids alike. </p>
    <p>The ego sucks it up faster than a sea sponge sucks up seawater. It’s addictive and I challenge any and all current SeaWorld &amp; Marineland trainers to take an honest look inside their hearts and tell me otherwise. </p>
    <p>What is truly confounding is how the veterans of the industry, the Kelly Flaherty-Clarks (current SeaWorld Curator of Animal Training) and the Brad Andrews (Chief Zoological Officer for SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment) can’t see the ethical contradiction they are living. They most of all should have a deeper understanding of the psychological needs of orcas, and they should understand the challenges in keeping them stimulated, healthy and socially balanced.    </p>
    <p>Regardless, after all these years, the orcas still damage themselves, still attack each other, still injure/kill the trainers and there is still a history of shortened life spans and health issues. </p>
    <p>What is further disheartening is that over time the public has been misled about life in captivity for orcas. What has been taught is veiled with lies and half-truths; especially so in the formative years of the industry. In reading through various blogs and threads of Facebook conversations, I found it astonishing that there were two camps on the issue of orcas in captivity: </p>
    <p>Captivity: Anti versus pro  </p>
    <p>Perhaps because we are on an island and virtually live with the orcas here, at the juncture of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Georgia Straight, I can tell you with confidence that if you stood on a downtown Victoria street corner all day and asked each person that walked past you, “Do you think it’s ok to have orcas in captivity?” I would be very, very surprised if even one single person said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I sometimes wonder if the difference in attitudes is contextual. Because we see them often and see them framed in their natural environment we have a greater appreciation for their magnificence and, where they belong.</p>
    <p>Whereas, much of the Pro-cap comments I’ve read are coming from people who greatly appreciate orcas and find them both awe inspiring and fascinating, but their experiences are based on what they have seen and heard at SeaWorld or Marineland. It’s the difference between real life and fiction.    </p>
    <p>Their real lives in the wild run much like this: Gliding through the sea with family, capturing a meal, swimming to the rubbing beach for a rock massage; then traveling to meet up with another pod they hear in the distance.  However, what the public typically sees in SeaWorld's Signature <em>Believe</em> Performance at Shamu stadium is pure showmanship -<em>the trainer's hands raised to the sky, jumbo-tron tower, soundtrack, synchronized backflips, fireworks, the grand finale! </em>The  orcas jump into an extremely busy environment of huge flashing video screens, loud speakers, crowd noise, and exploding fireworks which slam their sensitive echo-location systems like a punch to the jaw. </p>
    <p>Ironically, thanks to SeaWorld and IMATA (international marine animals trainer association), I gained a deeper understanding of the intelligence and social structure of orca families, which fermented my doubts that orcas should be held captive. Unfortunately, my empathy for their sorry life condition was overshadowed by the ego boost I enjoyed at being “a killer whale trainer”.  I spouted the same rationalizations that SeaWorld does today and I tricked myself into thinking that I was benefiting the orcas by facilitating their role as ambassadors for their species and helping the public understand them better. When I reflect on that time, I am embarrassed by my ignorance and my ego which had selfishly clouded my own judgement. <br>
  </p>
    <p>So, I would say to each trainer or aspiring trainer, to each curator, executive and especially to all the pro-caps and those of you who don’t want to lose the opportunity to visit with and appreciate the orca. Take a soul searching look inward and ask yourself, &quot;Am I being selfish?&quot; Are you putting your ego and desires at a greater importance than the needs of the animals you love? I did… and in that shadowy place in my soul, that place where I had secret  misgivings about myself, I hid my understanding of the part I’ve played in this tragedy. </p>
    <p>Never more!</p>
    <p>Do you have the courage to put the orcas' needs before your own? Though cliché, it has never been truer… </p>
    <p>If you love something, set it free! </p>
