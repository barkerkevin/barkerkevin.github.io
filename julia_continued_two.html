    <p> They talked until one by one the neighbours passed through the big iron gate and left abuela alone  under the Pichote tree in the courtyard singing softly to herself and drinking cognac. Then Julia heard the  even tenor of Father Quadra's voice again. He was trying to persuade abuela of something, until she said, with a degree of finality, &quot;No no I don't mix with those foreigners. They all come here wanting something. You black dresses want souls, the Portuguese <em>jacaré</em> want the cacao.&quot;<br>
      &quot;Yes, everybody wants something,&quot; said Father Quadra.<br>
      &quot;Well what about you God man, what you want?&quot; she asked. <br>
      &quot;Merely  God's will.&quot;<br>
      &quot;Ha. You priests think everything God's will. You think God change these slaves and these Tupi into merchants? You think God educate them, teach them manners and clocks? You make me laugh. God want them the way they are and so do the Jesuits and the Africans in the <em>candomblé</em> houses, them who are like children playing with potions and dolls. The <em>jacaré</em> will take everything in Bahia, and them and you too but not this place. I bring that Jew man here with the cacao and it grow for me. They leave this alone. You watch. You see.&quot;<br>
    He continued: &quot;And your family? What of them? Julia's education, her mother, who will provide for them?&quot; Abuela thought for a long time about this. &quot;You talk a lot about my family, father. Now let me ask you what it is you want. Everybody want something, like you say, well what about you, God man?&quot;<br>
  </p>
    <p>Father Quadra smiled. &quot;You're an interesting woman, abuela,&quot; he said at last. <br>
      &quot;You a damn strange priest,&quot; she replied.<br>
      </p>
    <p>Father Quadra excused himself and found his way under the moonlight to the gate, and she heard abuela whisper, as though from a long way away, &quot;I don't need to make you go, God man. Those jacaré take you in a big ship. You be in a dark place for a long, long time. You going to wish they burned you like that old fool in Lisbon...&quot; Then she hummed and sang softly and broke into phrases Julia didn't know but guessed were Nagô, the language of the Yoruba, and she remained like that either semi intoxicated or in a trance for the whole of the time it took her to fall asleep. Julia's grandmother was not African but <em>Cafuzo</em>, an Indian from the inland lakes and jungles.</p>
    <p>It was the savage part of her that still punted along silent rivers in dugouts and worshipped household gods.</p>
