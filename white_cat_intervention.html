  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; This eerie tale takes place in 1986, while visiting my mother in  Gloucester, Massachusetts, a quaint fishing town north of Boston, known for its  widespread faith in, and reverence for, the Virgin Mary. Verily, one suspects  an avowed cult of the Blessed V exists for the proliferation of Her Image in  lawn shrines and stone grottos. Atop Good Harbor Church She holds (not baby  Jesus!) but a sailing vessel in her arms, ensuring the safe return of the  town&rsquo;s Italian and Portuguese fishermen. Testament to the rough Atlantic winter  seas, monuments along the Boulevard list hundreds of Souls resting in Davy  Jone&rsquo;s locker. Gloucester is on the map since the harrowing tragedy of <em>The Perfect Storm, </em>and for  a mid-nineties, high-school, teenage-pregnancy pact.<span style="font-style: italic"> Ave Maria!</span>(genuflect  here three times).<br>
    &nbsp;  &nbsp; Nearby thrives the renowned, be-witched town of Salem. 1692 Puritan  finger-pointing, land-grubbing, and Indian War hysteria erupted in charges  accusing over two hundred men and

  <p>women of witchcraft, resulting in the death  sentences of nineteen New Englanders (by hanging for the most part, with one  poor Soul, Gilles Cory, being pressed to death with stones). A statue of  Nathaniel Hawthorne peers icily at the inquisitive as modern witch Laurie  Cabot holds court. At last visit I counted fifty shops catering to the occult,  and for good measure - Salem holds the largest, pagan, All Hallow&rsquo;s Eve  costumed street party in the country. New England reeks of Lovecraftian  cthulhu, while oozing Edgar Allen Poe-caliber macabre. Headless horsemen lurk  amid shacks of reclusive Tea Party refugees. Gloucester folk will spin you the  sad tale of Dogtown, a village wholly consumed by the Devil, its scanty  population of fish widows and stray dogs gone completely mad&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; As usual, I shebang into the Strange upon arrival. My mother  lived a stone's throw from <em>Heaven and Earth</em>, a  crystal shop and metaphysical bookstore operated by devotees of&hellip;&hellip;an  extra-terrestrial rock. Specifically; the gem-quality, translucent,  emerald-green tektite Moldavite which fell to Earth 14.8 million years ago, shattering  along the Moldau River in the Czech Bohemian plateau. Infused with specialized  properties,(pertaining to its mysterious origin and travel through Space), it  is theorized to be a form of obsidian meteorite ejected by a lunar volcano,  whose force of impact explosion, 6 trillion megatons, reversed the Earth&rsquo;s  magnetic poles. Amulets of Moldavite were found buried with the oldest-known  fertility cult Goddess, the Venus of Willendorf.<br>
    &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; The owners of <em>Heaven and Earth</em> happen  to be caretakers of a vast private collection of Moldavite and its main U.S.  distributers, clearly having invoked poetic license in classifying it &ldquo;<em>the Stone of the Holy Grail.&ldquo;</em> The shop  is filled to the brim with the raw and faceted gemstones in a variety of  finely-crafted jewelry, sculpture, art, and most significantly, silver and  gold Moldavite-inlaid Chalices - the Grails. The vibrational qualities inside  the &ldquo;temple&rdquo; were palpable, and the folks in attendance, (employees or cult  members?), appeared strangely trans-dimensional as well.<br>
    &nbsp;  &nbsp; True Seekers of their Craft&hellip;&hellip; thrilled by anything inter-stellar, I  bought a thumbnail chunk of Moldavite, amused as it bore resemblance to the  profile of a Mayan God, with an ear of corn for an ear (plus it perfectly fit  in my ear!). I also purchased a book (<em>The Keys Of Enoch</em> by J.J. Hurtak), cover inscribed with  gold-capped, rainbow pyramids, wherein the Archangel Melchizedek gifted  particulars on the electromagnetic grid surrounding the Earth, with detailed  locations of natural, and manmade vortices in degrees longitude and latitude!  Thrilled to explore Gea&rsquo;s treasure map, I returned to my Mother&rsquo;s attic. My  reading culminated in a purr-fect afternoon catnap. We had plans to attend a  Disney film, <em>The Flight of the  Navigator, </em>after dinner (my dearheart, Helen, Goddess Bless Her, humors the  off-kilter wackiness we share).&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note : present tense switch for suspense!&hellip;&hellip;..&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; As we head out that night, a scampering flash catches my eye on  the sidewalk, illuminated by a spectral Full Moon. Holy of Holies! The White  Cat!!! : a fetish / totem animal symbolizing the Supreme Powers of Enchantment,  Purity, and Good Fortune, in cultural mythologies worldwide, synonymous with  Wonderland&rsquo;s White Rabbit - Totemic Guardians of Secret Portals beyond Time,  Space, and Magician hats. White Cats specifically represent the Joy of  Immortality (and the Immortality of Joy!) for the enchanted, entheogenic  aficionado (especially beloved by the Norse Goddess Freya, everyone is familiar  with the Japanese &ldquo;maneki neko&rdquo;, the ubiquitous &ldquo;beckoning cat&rdquo; (with one paw  raised)). Naturally I am being called to worship, leaving Mom across the  street, dismayed, hands on hips, biting her tongue. The cat&rsquo;s back arches with  affection as I caper alongside it&hellip;&hellip;and go slack-jawed, as two willowy beings,  wearing hooded robes, manifest in front of me. I enter into a trance,  subconsciously registering a chilling fact: their shadowy features are  indistinguishable from hallowed, empty space. Cloaking devices? Telepathic  (hypnotic) transmissions reveal they are, indeed, my true brethren&hellip;..whom,  naturally, I am invited to accompany, with whatever Flesh they possess. Or lack  there of. No matter&hellip;.they possess my own. The White Cat / Extra-Terrestrial  Ambassador leads the Way. I begin to follow these excellent strangers, totally  oblivious my mother is witnessing my odd behavior from afar. &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; A familiar, maternal, &ldquo;<em>STOP! COME OVER HERE NOW!&rdquo;</em> rings out with panic-laced  Authority. I choose to rebel, resenting her selfish reasons to bust my destiny.  I&rsquo;m about to ditch her in my bewitchment, but her superpowers (boosted by  the Virgin) intervene to break my spell. It&rsquo;s not my fate to be led away by  these epic good folk to pagan LaLaLand after all&hellip;(reality letdown, vacuum-sucking  paralysis, mind-yawning regret)&hellip;.and so concluded the imminent threat (and the  present narrative). The Beings faded into NOTHINGNESS, as quickly as they had  appeared. I returned to Helen&rsquo;s side, and we were both left wondering <em>&ldquo;What the hell just happened? and who in Heaven&rsquo;s  name were they?&rdquo; </em>To this day,I am  still attempting to cognate the fact THEY HAD NO ASCERTAINABLE FACES!  Justifying her harsh intervention, my mother felt I was about to be harmfully, albeit willingly, abducted (and we&rsquo;ll never know). When we arrived at the  theater, the movie had been cancelled, the night ended; curtain drawn, ceremony  hidden&hellip;.. unbidden, the sacrifice remained alive?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Years later, I rented the <em>The Flight of the Navigator</em>. In a weird twist of fate,  I know the actor who plays the kid in the movie. He grew up in the rural  community I now live in (and coincidentally, makes sci-fi props for films). The  film&rsquo;s synthesized soundtrack is classic, cheesy eighties and the vicarious  fun watching twelve-year-old Joey Cramer navigate the silver pod is  irresistible, even with Paul (Pee-wee Herman) Reubens&rsquo; insidious voice at the  alien helm. It&rsquo;s <em>Twilight Zone </em>strange,  the storyline is about time travel and a UFO abduction (&ldquo;In 1978 a kid is  moved 8 years into the future&hellip;&rdquo;). Stranger still, as I do not drive, and have  never owned a car (after a brief, disastrous career), I stave off queries of  folks who find it odd, declaring : <em>&rdquo;I&rsquo;m saving my skills for a spaceship, and a road with no lines.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
