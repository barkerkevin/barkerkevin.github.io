      July, 2013 | Dateline: Accra, Ghana. By Jacqueline Murray | </p>

    <p><br>
    <span style="font-size: 12px"><a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/news/2014/02/u_of_g_prof_rec_1.html">... Jacqueline Murray is the recipient of this  year's 3M National Teaching Fellowship, widely considered to be Canada&rsquo;s top teaching honour ...</a></span></p>
    <p>Accra the capital of Ghana, formerly the Gold Coast, is a name that  used to conjure dreams of gleaming wealth. While evocative of nineteenth-century  colonialism, there&rsquo;s not much gold about this coast anymore. Rather, Accra&rsquo;s  aspect is now tinged with red.<br>
      The dirt in Accra is ubiquitous and very, very red. During  the rainy season, that dirt turns into oozing red mud and raging red rivers.  During the much longer dry season, the red dirt becomes a red dust that coats  absolutely everything. White or pastel clothing is out of the question: the red  dust dyes the fabric, pooling around the seams in particular. It does not wash  out. Hair is permeated and there are red swirls in the shampoo suds leaving a  lingering doubt that the red dust ever really washes out.<br>
      Perhaps the very worst aspect of the red earth is the ant  hills. Apparently, red dirt is particularly attractive to ants. These anthills  are eight foot high towers, pushing up into the tree canopy, even incorporating  and supporting full size trees growing from halfway up the hills. As arthropods  go, the builders of these soaring anthills warrant their own series of science  fiction movies. Every now and then, human beings exercise their dominance over  nature, knocking down an anthill so the land can be repurposed. Do these acts  of vandalism occasion heroic struggles between insect and human? It is  difficult to be certain, but it would appear the humans prevail, at least for  now. <br>
      Accra – and by extension Ghana – offers a layered  experience. Layers of histories coexist with layers of identities. Remnants of  many pasts intersect with presents from the global now. Take, for example, the  ban on drumming that pertains in Accra in the May/June period; it dates to the  prehistory of the Ga, the indigenous people of Accra.<br>
      Every year, in areas inhabited by the <em>Ga</em>, there is a six-week  ban on drumming and noise-making which is mandated by the Ga Traditional  Council. The ban is part of the observances of the Ga festival of <em>Homowo</em>, which  means &ldquo;to hoot at hunger.&rdquo; Homowo commemorates a famine sometime in the deep  past. It runs from May to late September and is celebrated to usher in the  farming season. The ban is imposed on all inhabitants of Accra, Ga and non-Ga  alike, and is part of the Ga&rsquo;s traditional religious practices. Moreover, they argue  that since indigenous customary practices are guaranteed by the 1992  Constitution of Ghana, all residents of Accra must respect the ban. And so, for  a few weeks, the music is stilled and the drums lie silent as contemporary  Accra bows to the imperatives of traditional society and marks a famine that  once troubled the Ga.<br>
      From the perspective of a visitor, Accra is familiar and  strange and perplexing. It is not an exotic capital city, such as <em>Istanbul</em> or  <em>Bangkok</em>, nor is it a bustling power centre, such as <em>Bejing</em> or <em>Washington</em>. Accra  is a crossroads of traditional, colonial and modern. All influence contemporary  Accra and the essence of Ghanaian values, those values that have resulted in  this country being perhaps the most stable democracy in all of Africa. <br>
      Religion is evident everywhere in Accra. Along virtually  every road and highway, billboards blast out the apocalyptic calls to prayer of  Christian charismatic and evangelical preachers, while the less strident sounds  of the muezzin&rsquo;s call to prayer waft across the city. Slightly less visible to  the uninitiated, but saturating the culture, are the vestiges of traditional  beliefs. Christianity is most obviously of the conservative ilk exported by the  United States, but the denominations of colonialism also endure: Roman  Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian.<br>
      Only about 5% of Ghanaians declare their religious  affiliation to be traditional, but traditional beliefs and values imbue life,  particularly in the villages, and they also endure in the cities. Traditional  beliefs, or at least cultural values and practices, cross the lines of  religious and tribal identities. For example, an Ashanti Christian, living in  Accra, performs traditional marriage rites, well in advance of the heavily  westernized church wedding. <br>
      Tribal ethnic identities then are sufficiently deep and  broad as to incorporate both Christians and Muslims, whether it be the <em>Dagbamba</em> of Upper East or <em>Ewe</em> people of Volta Region. The consequence of these religious  and ethnic juxtapositions is that Ghana is remarkably free from religious  intolerance and ethnic tensions. It is this harmony that sets in apart from so  many neighbouring African countries, riven by ethnic and religious violence.<br>
      At every turn, the contradictions and complications are  evident. This is a city, a country, that is fundamentally liminal. Ghana is  striving to be a twenty-first-century country with nineteenth-century attitudes  and twentieth-century tools. Much of the post-colonial 1960s infrastructure is  beginning to crumble. In many ways, Accra is a city of deferred maintenance.  The new George Walker Bush Motorway, the product of United States millennium  generosity, is fed by arteries of crumbling pavement disappearing under the  encroaching red dirt. Roadworks – the enduring British colonial term – are  tackled with a shovel and pick axe, a wheelbarrow and sheer human muscle power.  Here and there, fully-sealed air-conditioned condos are being built by men  using cement mixers and bamboo scaffolding.<br>
      Disjunctions and intersections are visible everywhere. A  tractor sits at the side of the road, the archaic Massey-Ferguson logo  discernible through the red dust. To encourage farmers, tractors can be  imported without duty, a significant concession on the part of the  cash-strapped government. Urban gardens are everywhere in Accra, on boulevards,  between houses, reclaiming garbage dumps. But these plots, large and small,  bursting forth with corn and cabbage, peppers and tomatoes, have never been  under a tractor&rsquo;s plough. They are cultivated by backbreaking labour, with traditional  short-handled hoes, no matter how large the plot.<br>
      The traditional short-handled hoe is complemented by the  traditional twig broom, used by men and women both, to sweep houses, courtyards,  even streets. The bundles of twigs are no more than two feet long and users  bend over, sweeping with one hand, the other firmly behind their back. As  gruelling as this kind of work may seem, there is a choice involved. There are  long-handled mops used to wash floors and long handled shovels for digging  ditches and roads. <br>
      There is an element of choice, to then, to the pervasiveness of  traditional tools. This preference for the artefacts of the past is observed,  too, in the endurance of traditional dress on the streets and in the offices of  Accra and in the careful greetings and vestiges of colonial <em>politesse</em> that  characterize social interactions. <br>
      How Ghanaians interweave their beliefs and their pasts, tribal  and colonial, Christian, Muslim and traditional, informs how they navigate the  globalized present, with a firm identity and without fear of cultural  homogenization. Theirs is a strong and enduring culture; it is a dynamic  culture one encounters daily on the dusty red streets of Accra.<br>
