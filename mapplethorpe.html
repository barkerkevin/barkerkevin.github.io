      <p>(Cont...)</p>
      <p>We climbed over logs and through the pampas and seagrass to her family's  cabin on the high bank above.         It was freezing and the sun was setting so we stoked a fire in the  potbelly stove. The  warmth began to creep over the threadbare rug to where I  lay propped up on the armrest of an overstuffed couch and I guess my body  language more or less beckoned her to climb on top of me.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well,  well...&quot;, I muttered.<br>
        &quot;Is that all you can say?&quot;<br>
        &quot;My, my, &quot; I added quickly.</p>
      <p>I felt her  fingers on my abdomen. The  sound of the sea oozed through the shiplap walls and formed a kind of  distant back rhythm. My flesh broke out in goosebumps.<br>
      </p>
      <p>'Are you cold?'<br>
        'No.'<br>
        She sat  upright. &quot;How do you show a girl you like her in that dark little world of  yours?&quot;<br>
        &quot;I throw a  rock at her.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Very mature.&quot;<br>
        Actually it was  true...<br>
        <br>
        She sat on my legs and shoved my woolly sweater up, exposing my torso from the  breastbone down. I felt a sudden rush of warmth from the fire on my skin. She  shifted off the couch and tugged her jeans down to her thighs, actually it was  less of a tug and more of a waggle, like I've seen women do in public a hundred  times before, when they hitch up their jeans. Except this was in reverse. A  waggle down, as it were.<br>
        I realized at  that precise moment that something about this scene was recognizable. It was  not an observation at all but a feeling which took root and grew and as quickly  morphed into an entirely different kind of feeling, one of dim recognition. Not  of her, or the place, or the frigid air of the cabin or the weird light of the  winter sun but the sensation itself . It was familiar, as though stemming from  some vague, prenatal memory.<br>
        The late afternoon filled the windows with the same pearly irridescence it cast  over the sea, giving her skin a kind of dull lustre, and I could hear the fresh  water rushing over the beach stones below the cracks in the floor, towards the  tiny bay beside the breakwater, and over the abyss to the twinkling lights of  Nanaimo, and amidst all the sensory jazz in this tiny shack on the high bank  above I felt her knee on my thigh, and a warmth which emanated from the silky  folds of some magic portal across the short divide.<br>
      The crazy  thought train started up again...&nbsp;<em>lickspittle, silky folds, juicyfruit  rumble .</em></p>
