    <p>Jonathan Franzen isn't a fan of e/books, or at least that's what he says. At the Hay Book Festival in Cartegena, Colombia last January the National Book Award winner <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Corrections-Novel-Jonathan-Franzen/dp/0312421273">(The Corrections. Farrar, Straus, &amp; Firoux. $10.88</a>) made the incalculable mistake of damning ebooks, and social media in general, with something less than faint praise. I wouldn't call it a rant exactly, it was more like a left handed compliment, because if someone like Franzen is even mildly threatened by e/books, and I'm not saying he is, merely that he appears to be, and appearances are reality in e/culture, then it's a compliment.<br>
         And if he isn't threatened he should be, if only for reasons which are crassly commercial. Electronic distribution may eventually cause book sellers and authors to suffer the same fate as composers and music publishers: Wide scale downloading and outright theft of copyrighted material. They probably already are. <br>
         But that's not what he reportedly said in Cartagena. His point was/is that the ethereal properties of electronic publishing are contributing to cultural impermanence, fueling a kind of accelerated genesis-to-scrap -heap process that will someday leave us all spinning rootlessly around in a surreal silicon world, bereft of anything tangibly real.<br>
         Perhaps. I suppose I would have been more impressed if he'd come out and said ebooks just aren't any good, like what many successful authors say about three-day novel writing contests. But if the past 10 years are any indication, that same publishing-at -the-speed-of-thought phenomenon he criticises is the only real guarantee they ever will be. Technological change has been for the better. More publishers, more writers, more interest, more titles in print and better presentation of them. Best of all, readers have become the supreme arbiters of what's good. Not publishers or even critics telling them what to buy.<br>
         I have to admit to being in tacit agreement with Franzen, however. At least in part. The whole point in having a literary establishment, such as that to which he is part and parcel, is having standards, and maybe even moving them incrementally higher. Once the barbarians start scrambling over the wall the whole world will be forced to pander to the public taste and there's no bottom to that.<br>
         Anyway I think the advent of easy peasy publishing is even more threatening to the dilettante because of the fine line between an unpublished author and a bad one. The former gets a certain amount of respect, feverishly beavering away on his or her manuscript in the attic, because no one can really come out and say they're lousy. They're a genius until proven otherwise. The published amateur however can indeed be proven otherwise, by anyone who can read.<br>
       So here then in honour of Mr. Franzen's remarks in Cartegena is a highly subjective sampling of the very bottom of that murky pond he alluded to. His antithesis, his <em>bete noir</em>, the barbarians at the gate and the <em>hoi polloi</em>, the guys who are threatening his royalties and cause him to sit bolt upright in bed in the middle of the night shouting, <em>those bastards</em>. The great unwashed e/book mob.</p>
