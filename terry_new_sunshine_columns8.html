    <p>Where the  Heck is Pender Harbour?</p>
    <p><em>This is the eleventh in a series of columns  of historical interest about places on the Sunshine Coast. It&rsquo;s meant to help  visitors and newbies to get to know something about us, but it&rsquo;s also useful to  old-timers who&rsquo;ve forgotten (or never learned) some of our stories. </em></p>
    <p>Have you  been to Pender Harbour? If you answer yes, I have to ask you, do you mean  Madeira Park? Or maybe Garden Bay or Irvine&rsquo;s Landing?  Because they&rsquo;re all Pender Harbour.  Put them all together and they spell  &ldquo;unincorporated community within the SCRD&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Pender  Harbour is a large bay with many inlets and some truly charming villages. It  was named in 1860 for Daniel Pender of the Royal Navy, when the British survey  vessel <em>Plumper</em> was plying these waters and naming every little cove,  promontory, bay and island in sight. Local terms for the area are &quot;string  of pearls&rdquo; and &ldquo;Venice of the North&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>The center  of the Pender Harbour collection of communities is Madeira Park, named by  Joseph Gonsalves, an early settler who came here from Madeira Island, near  Portugal. There are almost 2500 folks here who call Madeira Park and environs  home.  And why not? It's as close to Eden  as you could want, what with hiking trails, mountain climbing, great fishing,  commercial amenities such as an IGA, a liquor store, bank, and a brand new book  store and library.</p>
    <p>If you go to Garden Bay you must save enough time out of  your busy life to browse John Henry&rsquo;s General Store. You  won&rsquo;t find a store like this anywhere on the lower mainland. Not these days.  When you enter John Henry&rsquo;s you feel like you&rsquo;ve been transported back fifty  years.</p>
    <p>Al Lloyd built John Henry&rsquo;s in  1947. He hand-logged giant Douglas Firs from Garden Bay, and dragged them down  to the water so he could float them through Canoe Pass to Bargain Harbour.  Reg  Spicer&rsquo;s sawmill – a single rotary blade powered by an ancient Model-T engine –  cut the logs into planks, which Lloyd floated back again to build his store  with. Everything was done by hand. No power saws, no power staplers or hammers,  just human sweat. You can still see the axe marks on some of the old stumps in  the area.<br>
      In those days, people who lived  in isolated communities had two options: they could either order their  groceries and staples from Woodward&rsquo;s in Vancouver via Union Steamships, or  patronize one of the three area general stores. The storeowners weren&rsquo;t too  enthusiastic about you if you weren&rsquo;t a reg­ular. One old timer remembers going  to try to get some Pacific Milk from a store where he didn&rsquo;t usually shop.  Pacific Milk was like gold, then. The storeowner glared at him and said,  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not one of ours.&rdquo;  On another  occasion he was allowed two cans. &ldquo;But everyone else is getting six,&rdquo; he protested.  &ldquo;Yes, but they&rsquo;re <em>ours</em>,&rdquo; the owner  said.<br>
      The original St.  Mary&rsquo;s Hospital was built here in 1930 by  the Columbia Coast Mission, a branch of the Anglican Church. This was long before  the road was in, of course. All the  little coast commun­i­ties were  accessible only by sea. The Mission ships visited them on a regular basis to  provide religious and medical services. They also transported the injured, sick  and expectant mothers to St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital at Garden  Bay.   My drawing depicts it as it was then. The present St. Mary&rsquo;s was built  in Sechelt in 1964.</p>
    <p>Finally, Irvine&rsquo;s Landing lies at the mouth of Joe Bay,  the northernmost part of Pender Harbour. It was founded by Charles Irvine, who  opened a trading post here in 1865.  It&rsquo;s a popular place today, with camping, and a boat launch. And it  was he who sold the land to Joseph Gonsalves which  became Madeira Park. So you see? It all works.</p>
