    <p><strong>Story of the  Sunshine Coast</strong></p>
    <p>This is the first of a series of columns  about the history of my beloved Sunshine Coast. Over the next few columns, I'll  explore how Port Mellon, Langdale and the ferry, Gibsons, Roberts Creek, Wilson  Creek, Davis Bay, Selma Park, Shichalh, Sechelt, Redrooffs, Pender Harbour and  Egmont came to be. I've written them for the benefit of all you newbies who  have come here looking for Paradise (you've come to the right place, buddy) but  want to know more about it, and for the old timers who want a dip in the memory  pool. <br>
      The traditional Sunshine Coast stretches  from Port Mellon to Powell River and all the way to Lund, but these columns  will explore only the Lower Coast, from Earl&rsquo;s Cove to Egmont. That&rsquo;s because I  live in Sechelt, about halfway between the Langdale and Earl&rsquo;s Cove ferries,  and I draw and write about what I see around me. <br>
  &nbsp;When a person from the lower  mainland asks where I live, and I say &ldquo;Sechelt&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sunshine Coast&rdquo;, they often  say things like, &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re on an island, eh?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;How many ferry rides away  is that?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s only a forty-minute ride from Horseshoe Bay, but we might as  well be in Alaska. <br>
  &nbsp;To tell you the truth, the Sunshine  Coast is a bit of a secret, and a lot of us Coasters secretly like to keep it  that way.<br>
  &nbsp;When you disembark at Langdale you  have three options. Turn right to go to the Howe Sound Pulp and Paper mill at  Port Mellon (the end of the road, though they tell me that a good 4x4 could  navigate the old logging road to Squamish); turn left and you will pass through  tiny Hopkins Landing and Granthams Landing and reach Lower Gibsons, where you  can have a cuppa at Molly&rsquo;s Reach; or, lastly, go straight ahead up the hill to  the Upper Gibsons by-pass. Then it&rsquo;s on to Highway 101 and finalÂ­ly to Egmont and  the Earl&rsquo;s Cove ferry to Powell River.<br>
  &nbsp;Highway 101 was completed in 1955.  In the early days there were few roads linking only a few of our tiny  communities. Most of our traffic was by boat. The Union Steamship Co., the All  Red Steamships Line, Bert Whitaker&rsquo;s Sechelt Steamships Co. and the Black Ball  Ferries all plied these waters from 1889 till the advent of the B.C. Ferry Corp  in 1959, dropping off groceries, mail, bikes, radios and black socks for  Grandpa at Christmas to all the little wharves up and down the coast. <br>
  &nbsp;On Fridays, working fathers came to  spend the weekends with their vacationing families on the famous Daddy Boats.  What a thrill it was for the locals on boat day!<br>
  &nbsp;Thus there really is no such thing  as a single history of the Sunshine Coast. Rather, there are many histories of  the small communities that grew up in isolation before the advent of the  highway. I'll explore them one at a time. Stay tuned!<br>
