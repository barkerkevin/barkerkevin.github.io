    <p>Sweet  Gibsons, Jewel of the Coast</p>
    <p><em>This  is the fourth in a series of columns of historical interest about places on the  Sunshine Coast. It&rsquo;s meant to help visitors and newbies to get to know  something about us, but it&rsquo;s also useful to old-timers who&rsquo;ve forgotten (or  never learned) some of our stories. Much of the contents of this column was  originally printed in an earlier newspaper column and in Volume One of the  Sunshine Sketches trilogy.</em></p>
    <p>Gibsons  and its environs was originally inhabited by the Chek-welps of the Squamish  Nation. They called the area SK-JUNK, meaning &ldquo;man watching&rdquo; (from a rocky  headland). </p>
    <p>Francis  Wyngaert, in his <em>The West Howe Sound Story 1886-1976</em> (now out of print,  alas), wrote that the first Europeans to settle here were George Gibson, a  retired British naval lieutenant, and his two sons, George and Ralph. They  pre-empted land and began farming, selling their produce to the rapidly growing  city of Vancouver.</p>
    <p>George  Gibson was a real pioneer. He ran away from home in England in 1841 and went to  sea. Later he worked on the Mississippi river boats, then went to Ontario and  farmed. Finally he and his two sons came to B.C., where they searched for land  they could pre-empt and farm. </p>
    <p>They  were blown off-course in their hand-made sloop, the <em>Swamp Angel</em>, and  found themselves in what we now know as Gibsons harbour.  You can see his statue at the juncture of  School Road, Gower Point Road and Gibsons Way in Lower Gibsons. He is  remembered as a rather dour old chap, which is not surprising when you consider  that he was 58 when he homesteaded here. He pre-empted and cleared land, and  built a two-story home.</p>
    <p>In  the years following, the main sources of occupation were hand log­ging,  shingle-bolting, fishing and farming. <br>
      Between  1903 and 1910, there was an &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; of Finnish families who set up socialist  com­munes in Gibsons Heights, near what are now North Road and Cemetery Road.  Their in­fluence was later felt in the ideas of J.S. Woods­worth, the founder  of the CCF (now the New Democrat Party), who boarded for a time in the Gibsons  home of Dr. Frederick Inglis.  Inglis was  the only doctor on the Sunshine Coast for 33 years. His name is still revered  by folks in these parts.</p>
    <p>As  Gibson&rsquo;s Landing grew, so did the need for employ­ment. One of the most  successful operations was the Howe Sound Co-operative Canning Association, a  berry cannery that lasted from 1921 till 1952.</p>
    <p>In  1929 the Village of Gibson&rsquo;s Landing was incorporated. </p>
    <p>In  1950 the name was amended to the Village of Gibsons, and it became known as the  Town of Gibsons in 1983. Car ferry service between Horse­shoe Bay and Gibsons  began in 1951, ending when B.C. Ferries moved the terminal to Langdale in 1959.  Its population today is over 4,000.</p>
    <p>Gibsons  is known worldwide as the Home of the Beachcombers, C.B.C.&rsquo;s long-running TV  show. It ran for 19 years, and was seen in 45 countries. When I travel in  Europe, and people ask me where I&rsquo;m from, I always say &ldquo;Gibsons&rdquo; (even though I  live in Sechelt), and they always respond with, &ldquo;Oh, yes, the Beachcombers! Oh,  I would love to live there!&rdquo;</p>
