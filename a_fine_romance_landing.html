      <p> <span style="font-style: italic">DAVIS BAY &#8212; Home of the Eternal Optimis</span>t | by terry barker<br>
</p>
      <p>Davis Bay &#8212;There might be kids flying kites or building sand castles, or, if it happens to  be New Years Day, racing into the water in the annual freeze-athon. Lots going  on in Davis Bay.</p>
      <p>There aren't many places on the Sunshine Coast Highway  where you can actually see the ocean, but when you cross the little bridge at  Chapman Creek you'll be overwhelmed. There's Vancouver Island on your left, and  a sandbar (only at low tide, mind) that seems to stretch all the way to Nanaimo. <br>
      There might be kids flying kites or building sand castles, or, if it happens to be New Years Day, racing into the water in the annual freeze-athon. Lots going on in Davis Bay.</p>
      <p>Davis Bay was not named after its original owner.  It was pre-empted back around the turn of the century by a fisherman named  Chapman, who ran up such a bill to his supplier that he deeded the property to  him. The name of the supplier? Davis, of course. In 1939, when his widow passed  away, 160 acres of prime view property and beach front were bought by Ron  Whittaker for $10,000, and the sub-dividing began. It's still going on.</p>
      <p>Some years ago I interviewed the old timer who  built the Bella Beach motel. &quot;I was going to call it Vic's Motel,&quot; he  chuckled, &quot;but Vic is too far down the alphabet. So I called it Bella  after a girl in my high school Latin class.&quot; He told me about the wharf,  too. &quot;It was used by Standard Oil to supply their huge storage tanks on  Whittaker Road, but they're long gone now. It's used today by pleasure craft,  kids, lovers, and of course fisher folk.&quot;</p>
      <p>Ah yes, fisher folk. Another pioneer told me that  he remembered a banner year when almost 2,000 salmon were taken just from the  dock alone. `You could see them, big ones, swimming lazily around the  pilings,&quot; he said. I never went home without a few real dandies.&quot;</p>
      <p>I asked him about the wood carving of the  fisherman that stands on a piling near the end of the dock. &quot;It was done  by Terry Chapman,&quot; he told me. &quot;Remember him? You see his work all  over the Coast. A master craftsman he was. He told me that he just decided one  day to do a random act of kindness for his community. He'd fished here for  years and wanted to give something back. He said he carved the fisherman for  all the optimists who walk to the end of the pier hoping for a big catch. He  put it in place secretly one dark night with the aid of a full moon and a very  long ladder. Folks today can't read the caption under it any more -- it's been  worn away by the weather -- but it originally read THE ETERNAL OPTIMIST.&quot;</p>
      <p>The Davis Bay B&amp;B and the Bella Beach Motel  are situated right across the highway from the ocean, and there are wonderful  places to eat or browse for souvenirs. My own favoiurite is the Mosaic Market,  where Wendy will feed you <span style="font-size: 14px">carrot</span> cake to die for after you&rsquo;ve spent an hour or  so looking for curios in the other half of the building.</p>
