    <p><em>This is the tenth in a  series of columns of historical interest about places on the Sunshine Coast.  It&rsquo;s meant to help visitors and newbies get to know something about us, but  it&rsquo;s also useful to old-timers who&rsquo;ve forgotten (or never learned) some of our  stories. </em></p>
    <p><img src="Images/sargeant-bay.jpg" width="268" height="206" alt=""style="float: left;"/>There is a  host of interesting communities between Sechelt and Madeira Park, not the least  of which is West Sechelt, an amazing area which has grown like a volunteer field  of daisies in recent years. But there are others with their own stories – Sargeant  Bay, Coopers Green and Halfmoon Bay come to mind. Get off that damn highway, turn  on to Redrooffs Road, and take your time to explore these still-rural places.  It&rsquo;s worth the trip.Sargeant Bay is your first  stop. Watch for the sign and turn left. It&rsquo;s a splendid provincial park,  including a sand and gravel beach, a wetland, a salmon-bearing creek, forest, a  pristine forest bog and well-planned connecting trails. </p>
    <p>Frederick Sargeant pre-empted Sargeant Bay in 1887.  He cleared the land and farmed for twenty years, but after he sold to new  owners there was much dispute over the right use of the land, a natural habitat  for birds and animals. The government settled the issue by turning it into a  park in 1989.</p>
    <p>All the shoreline from  Welcome Beach to Halfmoon Bay James was acquired by James Rawding and Ephraim  Walker in 1891.  Rawding sold his portion  to a Vancouver firm in 1909, which constructed a summer resort called  Redrooffs. The double &ldquo;f&rdquo; is the old English spelling for &ldquo;red roofs&rdquo;, a  reference to the colour of the roofs of the cottages. They opened the Redrooffs  Trading Post in 1912 and added a recreation hall in the 1930&rsquo;s.</p>
    <p>Jim Green bought it in 1955 and turned it into a  trailer Park. The Sunshine Coast Regional District bought it and made it into a  park called Coopers Green. The above drawing shows the community center. I&rsquo;ve  had many a happy day there, playing horseshoes and eating cotton candy with my  grandchildren at the annual Halfmoon Bay country fair. My drawing today is of a  hotdog stand that served us some wonderful goodies a few years ago. It was  designed with a tow hitch, so I guess it&rsquo;s sleeping in some back yard now.</p>
    <p>Halfmoon Bay, the end of the road, is a community  of almost 3,000 folks. It&rsquo;s served by the famous Halfmoon Bay General Store,  where you can mail a letter, buy a beer and eat a fabulous ice cream cone.  There are also two art galleries and a variety of home studios which artists  open to the visiting public.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re  feeling adventurous, go to the dock and rent a   kayak to the Merry Island lighthouse. It&rsquo;s partly private property, and  the other portion is home to one of Canada&rsquo;s few remaining manned lighthouses. The island got its name from a survey conducted in 1865. HM Survey  Ship <em>Plumper</em> was surveying the coast line and naming our salient  features. The crew named Merry Islands after a winner of the Epsom Derby. </p>
    <p>There  are many stories about the heroism of Merry Island lighthouse keepers setting  out in terrible storms to rescue people, and it makes me wonder how well a  radar set would do under similar circumstances.</p>
    <p><em>Terry Barker is  the author of Boss Talk, The Five Minute Police Officer, More Sunshine  Sketches, Last of the Sunshine Sketches,   A Walk in Snickett Park and Last Chance This Life.
