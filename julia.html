    <p>&quot;Father Quadra is here,&quot; she said, without further explanation.</p>

    SCANT MINUTES before the HMS  Serpentine left port a woman brought a girl up the gangplank with a heavy case,  left her in the care of a Spanish nun, and promptly left.</p>
    <p>&quot;A donde vaya usted  nina?&quot; asked the nun.<br>
      &quot;Al Lisboa senora.&quot;<br>
    </p>
    <p>The nun summoned the bosun's  mate, who brought her before the captain, who dropped the gangplank for a  wildly gesturing couple who appeared suddenly on the dock.<br>
    </p>
    <p>&quot;I'm English,&quot; said the  man when he arrived breathless and little disheveled. &quot;Do I have the  honour of addressing the captain?&quot;<br>
      &quot;You do.&quot;<br>
      &quot;Then pray tell us what ship  this is and where it's bound.&quot;<br>
      &quot;His Majesty's Royal  Merchant ship Serpentine, bound for London with a sugar cargo ... and a little  girl too I believe.&quot; The captain winked at Julia and she smiled a timid  smile.<br>
      &quot;Oh good lord. Now see here, she must come with  us.&quot;<br>
      &quot;I don't understand.&quot;<br>
      &quot;My  wife and I ... well there's been a misunderstanding y'see.&quot;<br>
      The captain pondered this...<br>
      &quot;Bosun, am I to understand  the girl is not a legitimate passenger?&quot;<br>
      &quot;Not on the ship's list sir.  We just have the Spanish lady as far as the Azores.&quot;<br>
      &quot;I see. Well carry on  then.&quot; And the man went down the gangplank with Julia and her trunk.<br>
      &quot;Damned Spanish  idiots,&quot; said the captain.<br>
      &quot;Portuguese, sir,&quot;  corrected the bosun. &quot;Though the one who brought her onboard looked a bit  of a darkie. Damn fetching if you ask me. Ever had one,  sir?&quot;<br>
      &quot;Shut up bosun,&quot; said  the captain.<br>
    &quot;Yes sir,&quot; said the  bosun.</p>
    <p>It was Maria the maid who roused  the family's English neighbours after Mario left with Julia's mother and her  case, and they flew as fast as hooves would carry them to the dock.<br>
      &quot;Damned lucky thing there was  only one ship there today,&quot; said Jonathan when they had Julia safely in  the coach, and his wife agreed.<br>
      &quot;Extraordinary thing to  do. Never heard of such a thing in all my days. You must come and stay with us  you poor child. Oh dear, she doesn't understand me. Speak to her  Jonathan.&quot;<br>
      &quot;Você fala inglês?&quot; he asked<br>
      &quot;Não falo,&quot; said  Julia.<br>
      &quot;Julia must come to our  house as often as possible,&quot; pronounced Jonathan's wife, and he nodded  reluctantly. Julia was unaccustomed to the creamy charm of the English, and too  young to understand that it was entirely conditional.<br>
      &quot;At least she has a roof over  her head,&quot; said Jonathan, &quot;and that's more than I can say for the  entire royal court of Lisbon. They've been out of doors since the earthquake,  the lot of them, living in tents in a field somewhere. Extraordinary! Anyways that  maid has a head on her shoulders, and the old lady is always there....&quot;<br>
      &quot;Oof! I cannot abide that  woman. Perhaps the priest...<br>
      &quot;Oh God no. He'll just  send her to one of those horrid convents. Do you know I can't tell those  damned Jesuits from the heathen? You saw them on the roads the other day,  walking with them, even speaking their lingo.&quot; Jonathan spoke Portuguese  perfectly although the local dialect baffled him.<br>
      `Well then tell her we'll come  and visit more often, just to see how she's getting on,&quot; and he did.<br>
      &quot;Que me quieria quedar en  el cruzero,&quot; replied Julia.<br>
      &quot;Ha. She says she wants to  stay on the ship.&quot;<br>
      &quot;I can't say as I blame  her.&quot;</p>
    <p>Their coach passed the port  building and the pier where boats ferried people to the islands in the Bahia  Todos os Santos, and the seabreeze that fanned them smelled of clove and the  charcoal fires from the tiny bairros of the lower town. A kind of pagan melee  always erupted here before Semana Santa, the holiest week in the Christian  calendar, which coincided with the celebration of the harvest, and the festivities  grew more widespread and intense as the Jesuits lost control of their  converts. Bands of revelers roamed the streets wearing animal skins and huge  paper-mache heads representing the full panoply of African and Tupi gods. They  gathered on corners with the vendors and drummers, or by small cooking fires  where the mai de santos of the Candomblé houses dispensed banana leaves with  cooked yams and goat. The sound of the samba and drumming came from every house  and street corner, and from the alleys and rooftops too. Dancers in strips of  cloth and leather moved seductively to the samba de roda, or lay on the ground  overcome by exhaustion and intoxication, or merely swayed and stared fixedly  into the distance. Julia recognized many of the faces  and body types who filled the narrow street below the ornate  balconies of the houses - the undulating Bantus,  and the lighter skinned Cafuza, and the short tribespeople in countless shades  of black and tan and cinnamon. Their hair was braided with sticks and cowry  shells, and charms hung from their belts and bracelets to ward off smallpox, or  cholera, or any of a host of ailments that afflicted the people of the new  world. Progress became difficult and  then impossible as the small black coach stopped for a procession led by a  woman holding an icon of the Virgin Mary. The acolytes who followed were in long  white robes and skull caps. Julia knew she was the mother of a Candomblé family  on their way to a feast or an initiation, but she could not identify one of  their party, a masked man who careened through the crowd in an erratic manner  suggesting he was under the influence of one of the herbs the Yoruba took  during festivals. She had never seen this kind of public ritual before. Perhaps  it was Macumba or Vocu, or a hydrid of some kind. He caught Julia's eye and darted  towards the coach, thrusting his head through the tiny guillotine window. The  mask fell off and revealed eyes which were wild and bulging, and the whites of  them stood out against the blue black face. He smelled of sweat and charcoal,  and stared at Julia speechless but with growing recognition, and she too  glimpsed something familiar as she looked into the black eyes, only she  couldn't say what it was. Then he smiled, and his eyes rolled back in his head  which shook vigorously, and he said something to her in Nagô.</p>
    <p>Jonathan's wife rapped him on the  forehead with her fan and he faded back into the street.<br>
    </p>
    <p>&quot;I think he just wanted a few  coins my dear,&quot; Jonathan said. ¬</p>
