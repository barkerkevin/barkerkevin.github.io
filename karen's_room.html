        <p style="font-size: 18px">This is Karen&rsquo;s room. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px">Long before we built  the house, when we were still in the <em>wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have a house we  designed ourselves</em> stage, she said she wanted her own room. A room where  she could read, where she could write, paint, sew and think. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><br>
        &ldquo;It has to have morning light,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;And I have to see the sun set on Vancouver Island from it. And it has to have  a daybed.&rdquo; I was never sure why it had to have a daybed; but if Karen wanted a  daybed, it would have one. I would give Karen anything she wanted. She held  down two jobs to put me through law school; I owed her everything. <br>
        She told me I was a great lawyer, although I  never thought I was. She told other people I was too, and they believed her  because everyone always believed Karen. She told someone that at one of those  dreary lawyer parties in Vancouver and a week later I got a phone call. <br>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for someone with your  specialty,&rdquo; the authoritative voice on the telephone said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come  up and see us?&rdquo; <br>
        And it was up. Very very up. The firm liked  me and they loved Karen. Within two years we were thinking that our own house  was a possibility. Within four years, we were looking at property on the  Sunshine Coast. <br>
        &ldquo;The view is spectacular,&rdquo; the real estate  agent said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about 300 feet down to the ocean, so I wouldn&rsquo;t count on  daily swims; but from the prominence, you can see the sunrise over there and  the sunset about there&hellip;&rdquo; <br>
        The next morning, we huddled in down jackets  in the pre-dawn mist. The morning sun slivered though the clouds at the head of  the inlet and caught Karen&rsquo;s smile in its golden glow. As the sun burst over  the cloud bank, she danced and her shadow slid over the massive expanse of  granite we knew would hold our new home. We stayed there until the last embers  of the sunset burned out on Vancouver Island. We couldn&rsquo;t get back to our  apartment fast enough to the real estate lady. <br>
        The first drawings were on the backs of  envelopes and shopping lists. By the time we graduated to typing paper and  graph paper, cedar beams, stone fireplaces and rustic staircases came and went:  their inclusion and exclusion was debated. But the floor-to-ceiling glass  windows were never an issue. &ldquo;It will be hard to heat,&rdquo; the architect said.  &ldquo;The storms will blow straight at that southwest corner where those big windows  are.&rdquo; Karen just shook her head. &ldquo;No, that room will be warm.&rdquo; <br>
        And it is. I can sit here now &ndash; at her  writing desk or on the daybed or in the teak sling chairs she loved to curl up  in &ndash; and feel the first warmth of the sun in the morning. I can see that  morning-orange light illuminate her book cases and paintings all around me. As  the sun moves out toward the ocean, the room fills with the crystal blue light  of day that inspired her writing. And when day is done, the butterscotch sunset  light floods this room with the warmth and love we knew here. <br>
        The last, sangria light of the day hits the  corkboard that&rsquo;s overpopulated with pushpins holding photographs, letters,  postcards and, in the bottom right hand corner, a note in her handwriting that  just says &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo; It was the last thing she wrote before she died. <br>
        This is Karen&rsquo;s room.</p>
