    <p style="font-style: italic">This is  the second in a series of columns about the history of Sunshine Coast  communities.</p>
    <p><em>by terry barker</em>  &#8212;You can't talk about Port Mellon without also telling the history of  Howe Sound and Pulp and Paper, especially since it celebrated its centennial  a few years back -- and since the very paper you are reading this column on - if in fact you were reading it in the Coast Reporter - was  produced there. </p>
    <p>What we now know as Port Mellon was once called Klee-koh-ken by the  Coast Salish people who lived here before the Europeans came and renamed  everything. Their ideal lives were changed by the mini-gold rush of 1891 that  brought Captain Charles Cates to Rainy River. There was no gold to be found,  but in 1908 Captain Henry Augustus Mellon and his partner Greely Kolts bought  the Cates land and started a mill to produce wrapping paper for the Vancouver  market. Maybe they thought there'd be gold in them thar rolls of paper. </p>
    <p>Their company failed, the first of a long string of flops under a  variety of names until 1951, when Canfor bought it. In 1988 Canfor partnered  with the Oji Paper Company of Japan and together they have successfully steered  it through good times and bad till the present day. </p>
    <p>My friend, Al Strang, told me that the mill employs 450 workers who  support Coast communities in a big way by paying rent or mortgages, buying food  at our groceries and paying the taxes (poor souls) that pave our roads and keep  our schools going. Al is Manager of Technical and Environment, so he should  know, eh? </p>
    <p>&ldquo;The past few years have not been kind to us  economically,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;The size of our workforce has  shrunk along with the global newsprint market. But on the other hand we are  experimenting with trial orders of other grades – high brightness paper for  newspaper ad inserts, and book paper, for instance. We&rsquo;re also working on ways of  generating more electricity. Things are looking up!&rdquo; </p>
    <p>I like to think of the lives of those early paper makers. They may have  lived in tar-paper shacks but they loved to party, so the stories go, and sure  enough, there was a beer parlour nearby. The famous Seaside Hotel was just  across Rainy River from the mill. When the bridge washed out, thirsty party-goers  picked their way across the creek on the wet rocks. Not too hard to get there,  but if you scarfed too many beers it could be tricky getting home. </p>
    <p>Friday nights Gibsons Landing folks used to boat over to the Seaside,  and on Saturdays the Port Mellon people would boat back to Gibsons Landing.  Their only land connection with the village of Gibsons Landing in those early  days was a dirt road, which wasn't paved till 1953. Before that time only a 4x4  jeep could make the trip. It took almost two hours to ford the streams and get  though the wash-outs. </p>
    <p>I think of Port Mellon geographically as the anchor to the Sunshine  Coast. It sits at the bottom of our map. But it's another kind of anchor as  well -- a respected employer that keeps many of our Coast people working and  building our community. </p>
