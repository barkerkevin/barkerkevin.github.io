    <p>Memories of Wilson Creek</p>
    <p><em>This is the sixth in a series of columns of historical  interest about places on the Sunshine Coast. It&rsquo;s meant to help visitors and  newbies to get to know something about us, but it&rsquo;s also useful to old-timers  who&rsquo;ve forgotten (or never learned) some of our stories. </em> <br>
      Hey, traveler, if you're driving from Langdale to Earl's Cove today, you  might miss Wilson Creek altogether. It's a small place, just a single road  actually, with dead-end offshoots. You just might be forced to stop at the  traffic light at Field Road, and you just might glance to the right and spy the  IGA Mall and think about getting some groceries – or, looking at the stores, consider  brewing some wine, eating a pizza, consulting a doctor, getting a prescription  filled, renting a video, buying a gift, dressing for an adventure or scarfing a  coffee -- but then the light turns green, off you go. In a hurry to get  somewhere else.  No Wilson Creek for you  today.<br>
      Enjoy the ride: the road from Wilson Creek to Sechelt was completed in  1912, and not paved till 1919. The rest of the highway, from Langdale to Earl's  Cove, wasn't paved till the mid-fifties. <br>
      Like all the Sunshine Coast places, Wilson Creek has its own special  interest and charm. It has an airport, a gated marina community, a salmon  enhancement hatchery and a splendid campsite, as well as an interesting  assortment of homes and industries.<br>
      I was first attracted to the area by The Homestead, a tiny log cabin which  sat at the corner of Field and the highway many years ago. They served the best  coffee and eggs-basted that I had ever eaten, well worth the drive from  Gibsons. It was built in 1919 and sold to the Sunshine Coast Wildlife  Rehabilitation Center for a dollar in 1992. They hauled its numbered logs to  acreage on Trout Lake Road, where I found its remains in 1999. It had been  reassembled by Harold Swanson and was being used to help rehabilitate hurt  animals. It's gone from there now, but where? Like so many things on my beloved  Coast, it has wandered off into limbo.<br>
      Wilson Creek was pre-empted by William Simpson, but for some reason it was  named after a local blacksmith, Jim Wilson. He worked for Burns and Jackson  Logging. It was the Jacksons who built that gracious house at the opposite  corner from the Homestead in 1936, where they presided over their log boom  storage area. You might have glimpsed it while you were stopped at that traffic  light at Field and the highway, if you had looked left. Don&rsquo;t look now, though  – like The Homestead, it has gone.</p>
    <p>Turn right, traveler, and spend some time at the Salmonid Hatchery. Go up  Field Road till you see the sign. Follow the narrow gravel single-lane road  down the hill till you find a magical opening in the forest where some dogged volunteers  and a couple of employees raise thousands of salmon, steelhead and cutthroat  trout and return them to Sunshine Coast rivers and streams. I talked with Bob  Anstead, the amiable manager of the site, who has been running the program for  17 years. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re open to the public every day except Sunday,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;9:30  to 3:30 every day except Sundays. Tell your readers to come on down.&rdquo; </p>
