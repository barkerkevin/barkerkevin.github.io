      <br>
I've  always marvelled at the stoic silence the free world has maintained over Hugo  Chavez. There have been no cries of <i>regime change</i> from Washington, no <i>coalitions  of the willing</i> rolling across the oil fields towards Caracas. Not even a  recent peep from the U.S. State Department about election fraud.</p>
    <p>What's  the reason for this <i>cordon sanitaire </i>of averted eyes and stilled voices?  Is it merely the icy deference that rational people characteristically bestow  on the mildy insane? There is an extremely reckless theory that maybe Chavez  wasn't all that bad and there just wasn't much to object to, but nobody seems  to want to go there. </p>
    <p>      I think  it's plain indifference. The last time the northern hemisphere paid attention  to South America, taking it at face value, we became intrinsically involved in  a brutal 20 year dictatorship in Chile and waged a short, sharp war over some  islands off Argentina. Sure, the <i>dictadura</i> was good for transnationals,  but nobody in their right mind wants a repeat of it. We live in a kinder,  gentler world now, where Obama's drones do all the dirty work. <br>
  </p>
    <p>At the  time of the Falklands War, which our heads of state generously referred to as <i>Las  Malvinas</i> at last year's disastrous summit in <b>Cartagena, Colombia</b>, we  still had apartheid. Something the British government was more or less tacitly  ok with back in those dark days. Not so now.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The last  good look I had at Chavez and South American politics <i>en toto</i> was a  televised, pan Caribbean presidential summit a few years back. It was quite a  show. <i>Daniel Ortega</i> produced a hand-drawn map of<i> San Andres</i>, a  Colombian archipelago off the coast of <b>Nicaragua,</b> and said rather  brusquely that his country wanted it back. Colombia's <i>&Aacute;lvaro Uribe</i>, the  former strongman president who is now engaged in a relentless Twitter battle  with the current leadership, produced a series of emails retrieved from the  laptop of a recently slain<b> FARC</b> commandante which detailed wire payments  to Ecuador president <i>Rafael Correa</i> in exchange for safe haven. Uribe had  just worked himself up into a lather when Chavez interrupted and began to sing.  Everyone laughed and it was smiles until tea time. Hey, this is South American  bilateralism. I'm not making it up.<br>
    </p>
    <p>So it's  not hard to imagine why the southern Hemisphere gets little more than a  collective yawn from the north. Even the million dollar question posed today by  the <b>El Spectador</b> newspaper, &quot;<i>will the Chavista revolution  survive</i>?&quot; is rather academic. A potentially better question is whether  Chavez has a real shot at martyrdom. Martyrdom needs a conspiracy, like the one  generated by Chavez himself over the mysterious demise of South American  liberator <b>Simon Bolivar</b>. </p>
    <p>      I said I  didn't believe the CIA murdered Chavez. I didn't say he wasn't murdered.</p>
    <p>      You also  need sweeping, beneficient acts, acknowledged by your peers. Colombian  president <b>Juan Manuel Santos</b> used the ubiqitous Twittersphere today to  issue condolences to Venezuelans, and came tantalizingly close to recognizing a  Chavez accomplishment or two. Among those are the severe reduction in extreme  poverty and infant mortality, which our governments are reluctantly forced to  admit were kind of ok. Not the sort of thing that gets recognition from banks and  oil companies, the people who count. But they did happen. <br>
    </p>
    <p>He also  had friends on Wall Street, including Goldman Sachs and OppenheimerFund Inc,  both earning up to 14.7% annually (aggregate 681% over the decade!) on  Venezuelan bonds by playing the ongoing fiscal crises rather expertly. You see,  Chavez was willing to siphon off the country&rsquo;s oil wealth to pay creditors, as  a way to counter start/stop growth, falling reserves, and the dearth of foreign  investment. The nationalization policies of the <i>Chavistas</i> that kept  investors away in droves resulted in a whopping 12% in borrowing costs - a full  four points points higher than other developing nations. High anxiety means  high bond yields. But contrary to popular predictions the country did not land  in default. Indeed, he never missed a payment. Those guys made out like bandits  on Chavez.<br>
    </p>
    <p>So just  what is the world's problem? Despite countless conversations with expatriate  Venezuelans over the past 10 years, one of them an army colonel involved in the  illfated 2002 coup in Caracas, (hello there Charles), I have yet to gather a  tangible reason for their vehement hatred of Chavez. Yeah, he was a dictator.  That's bad I guess. What did he really do? Well he dictated. <i>Tsk</i>. Ok,  what else? High crime in Caracas, expropriations, tough money laws, plummeting  currency. Well the latter two aren't so bad. In fact my own native land -  Canada - would fare extremely well from a currency devaluation: The factories  would run 24/7 and we'd have full employment. <br>
    </p>
    <p>You could  say, as some New York based human rights watchdogs do, that he played fast and  loose with constitutional law and rigged elections. Doesn't everybody these  days? I mean <i>come on</i>. And where is the evidence linking Chavez to  murder, embezzlement, and treason? Where are the victims and the families of  victims? Where are the stories of fighter jets strafing refugees on makeshift  rafts, the revelations in the world press about offshore accounts and wire  transfers and webs of interlocking companies, like <i>Aleman</i> in <b>Nicaragua</b>,  and <i>Fujimori</i> and <i>Montesino</i> in <b>Peru, </b>and <i>Cheney</i> in  the<b> U.S.</b>? Where are the whistleblowers?<br>
    </p>
    <p>I think  hating Chavez is the most bourgeois thing you can do. His common man speech,  his Mussolini like posturing, and the endless Castro style speeches were  calculated to get on the nerves of certain people. Banks and industries were  nationalized, people were thrown out of work, and it became next to impossible  to move money around. No, that's not the United States I'm talking about silly!  But it sounds like home <i>dunnit</i>? <br>
    </p>
    <p>This just  in ... apparently the <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/koch-brothers-hugo-chavez-and-the-xl-pipeline">Koch brothers</a> murdered Chavez.<br>
      </p>
    <p>Now that  I can believe.</p>
