      <p>... or  &nbsp;so I imagined. Actually she turned out  to be Basque, not German at all. Her name was Merenxu, with a soft S in the  last phoneme. Meren-<i>shoe. </i>        </p>
      <p>Her store window said closed for the Beltene Fires. I asked what that was and she explained it was some kind of pagan festival, adding  &ldquo;the owner is a druid.&rdquo; As though offering proof of same the vegan restaurant we entered beside it carried the full panopoly of New Age <i>bon mots</i> and squalid latter day secular Gods on its message board, and actually failed to <em>yield</em> on  the first try which is actually very <em>in character</em> for vegan restaurant doors. I was about to give  it a shove when somebody opened it and I fairly fell into the vestibule,  frightening a busboy. We sat and warmed ourselves by a gas heater. She  busied herself with her kidskin gloves while I gazed through the dyed curtains at  the frost melting on some azelias in the morning sun until somebody nearby said:  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the boll  wievel to the farmer, man,&rdquo; and immediately caused me to think of the word <em>lickspittle</em>, owing to the tiny slug trail of saliva that ran from the  corner of the speaker&rsquo;s mouth, and of Klaus Kinski who utters the word so  brilliantly during his scene with Doctor Zhivago on the train to Yuriatin.  Kinski had a great sneer. I&rsquo;ve always admired it.<br>
        &nbsp;&ldquo;All these money people and the death oriented  oil interests. Don&rsquo;t they know it&rsquo;s the age of Pisces?&rdquo;<br>
      &ldquo;....Aquarius,&rdquo; I  chimed in. The dreads swiveled towards me in menacing way and said: &ldquo;Screw off.&quot; &nbsp;I opened my mouth to reply but nothing came  out. I&rsquo;d never been told to screw off on astrological lines before. The guy had blonde  dreadlocks, about sixty, with deep lines on his forehead and a sullen  expression. He seemed oafish at first but on second sight became rather more  lizardlike, even cunning. <br>
        ...&nbsp; and thence to my companion, who sat with  Buddhist concentration studying a single strand of hair, and as she did so the  light seemed to creep through the latticed window and gather around her like a  mantle, the whole image dissolving into something slightly abstract, squares  and rectangles heaving around in a golden, textured sea. Fragmented yet whole,  like a Klimpt mosaic, and mythic in a way. &nbsp;Suddenly I felt something large and unyielding  shoot up my nose and begin sucking my brains out. My thoughts unhinged and  swirled downwards toward an abyss. I heard melodies and lyrics from musical  films. Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens; the drooling man and  lickspittle; unfamiliar scenes from past lives like a cold bright desert;  running through the streets of Munich at night hopping fire hydrants. The world  shrank to a raster with white noise which gave way to an industrial soundtrack;  the repetitive sound and imagery of steampunk; Eraserhead; the dark nihilism;  the holy ghost; the Brixton Academy in London where waiters bring trays of  stimulants and people pick each other up by asking if you have a cig; the warm  bars of Dusseldorf&rsquo;s nightclub district in brisk autumn where they play  American blues and serve razor thin crepes crusted with sugar for breakfast;  the fall of Saigon; the Wide Sargasso Sea; the boll wievel to the farmer and <i>the slip man the slip can you not conceive</i>? The blue eyes peered out of  the raster and were no longer pale but glittering and she asked <i>have you got  a cig</i>?, or I thought she did, or they were words to that effect, and I  wanted to say lickspittle and mangled the word but man I was <i>thisclose </i>...<br>
      &nbsp;&lsquo;Hell is other people.&rdquo; I said, and she  blinked. I was now incapable of speaking in anything but quotations by Jean  Paul Sartre. I felt my psyche collapsing under the weight of my own  existentialism, run over by my own crazy thought train, pounded flat like the  Saturday morning crepes advertised on sandwich boards in Dusseldorf&rsquo;s Altstadt  district.</p>
      <p>I  said, &ldquo;Where is your family from?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Originally?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Sure,  why not?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Berlin.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;But  you said...&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Basque,  I know. On my mother&rsquo;s side&hellip; &ldquo;. The Klimpt mosaic came back into focus, aureate  patches that pulsed and hummed and went parabolic. I could see gilded images in  them. She was mythically interesting again.<br>
  &ldquo;Did  you know when they renovated this place they uncovered some old handwriting on  a crossbeam?&rdquo; she said at last.<br>
  &ldquo;No.  What did it say?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;The  war is still on and it&rsquo;s still raining.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Why  d&rsquo;ya suppose anyone would bother to write that?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been trying to figure that out.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Perhaps  because they both seem to go on forever.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;But  they don&rsquo;t go on forever,&rdquo; she said, which seemed a perfectly sensible thing to  say.<br>
  &ldquo;I said they seem  to,&rdquo; I replied quickly, and that was a sensible remark to put with hers. </p>
      <p>&yen;<br>
        We  stood on the tiny bridge below Little John&rsquo;s and dropped pebbles into pools of  dark burgundy with butterscotch foam.<br>
        &ldquo;I  know that guy with the dreads,&rdquo; she said.<br>
        &ldquo;Yeah?  What&rsquo;s his story?&rdquo;<br>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s part of some  local cult that worships trees.&rdquo; The Klimpt was drifting in and out of focus  now, though the colours were less vivid.<br>
        &ldquo;What, like those  people who go to Glastonbury every year?&rdquo;<br>
        &ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;<br>
        &ldquo;Do you believe all  that?&rdquo;<br>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to believe?  It&rsquo;s just a way some people relate to the world.&rdquo;<br>
        &ldquo;Do you relate to  it that way?&rdquo;<br>
        &ldquo;Oh god no.&rdquo; She  paused, then said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make an enemy of him.&rdquo;<br>
        &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br>
        &ldquo;He owns my  store.&rdquo;She tossed a pebble into the water below. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>
        &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;<br>
        &ldquo;To the pier. I  want to walk on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>We hiked down to  the mouth of the creek where the steamships used to tie up. The old pilings  were gone but the breakwater still jutted out to sea. It was overgrown with low  scrub and blackberries and someone had erected a wooden sculpture and some  benches at the end of it.<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always liked  Germans,&rdquo; I said, feeling suddenly jolly. We stood on a vast sandbar exposed by  the tide, and I had a sudden memory of playing baseball here in the &lsquo;70s. In  the distance was a point shrouded in steely mist and beyond that (I knew!) a  cabin where my grandfather spent his leaves during the war. The shore looked  like one of those Japanese paintings of cold beach stones and delicate cedar  boughs poking through a curtain of fog.<br>
  &ldquo;Why  Germans?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re  educated. You probably know who Durrenmatt is.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;The  playwright?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;You  see?<br>
  &ldquo;What  do you know of Durrenmatt?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;I  had to perform a scene from Der Physiker in college.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  that about some nuclear scientist with a terrible secret...?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;How  does it end?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. I only read the part I had to memorize,&rdquo; and she laughed at this.<br>
  &ldquo;Durrentmatt was Swiss,&rdquo; she said.</p>
