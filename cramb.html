    <div id="dateline">Adam Cramb is an urban artist and poet from Powell River, B.C. who writes in a disembodied poetic style; at once lyrical and dissonate; fragmentary and only very loosely thematic. He illustrates his own work with photography and collage.</div>

      <p>Teenage novella 2</p>
      <p>by adam cramb</p>
      <p>Or of what you are are you is all that we care of you is  what they told you you would have to give when you were born and now you regret  this application. To walk alone home amongst these messages . Between these  teenage lines there is a contemptuous ravaged compulsion. And we rage. In this  fiction are these cries lies or are they wriiten within for the others does he  even think  for himself. Fiction.  Fiction. Can one be sure? For these un-born messiahs, prophetless. These  un-born myth ragers. Are we all too too progressive for letters. We are indeed  these Devil's childrens.<br>
        Only in spirit though. Only in our spirits. Streetwalkers  compounded and bound. Are you really hot(chaud) or just stupid? A post post  dharma. Scribblings of poems  upon  rippled cardboard scraps greased soaked, riddled. Spread aloof, scuffed and  shuffled my children. You do not want this life. It can not change upon  desires. A determination too quickly becomes mass solmen. A heart is breaking.  For lack of a better word, un-bound. A slaughter. I am not bold not brave like  massacres. A childerns youth like you do not want this life Boys. You broken  boys so sun varnished and sun shine polished. Your backs.  Ravens and sisters no longer waiting. Such  assumptions are desperate longings. Anxiety will tell us that your dreams can  never be fufilled. The rest of your life just filler. Like the last ten years.<br>
        When your body has given its last moments. It will have  given them to others. They don't want them. They need them. They don't want  them. They can't wait to die. What do they demand? Never conspiratated. How  passionless, how powerful. But somehow they make a life of it and make-up like  sex bunnies. Waiting for themselves. Waiting on somebody's forboeding. Waiting  for their next big break. Broken.<br>
      The best peice of advice I can give you is to invest years  into insult without too much feeling. Leave the last parts of your purpose to  despising your parents. Even  if you  can't really write, eventually you will bury yourself in the wilderness.  Literally consumed. You born with evrything you need to make it on your own. A  biiter longing emptiness of something missing in your life. Your purpose.  Unconditional words repeating themselves. Swiftly driftless abstractions,  regrettable and un-reasonable. Forceless forms jostle for placement across your  brow. It in this summer's figures that relay our startled movements. Words we  should not know but are delivered upon our shorelines. &ldquo;Be excellent to each  other!&rdquo;</p>
